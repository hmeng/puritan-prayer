## Who Were the Puritans, Really?

Mention "Puritans" to the average person today, and you might conjure images of stern-faced individuals in black clothing, frowning upon any hint of joy or pleasure. This caricature—reinforced through centuries of misrepresentation—couldn't be further from the truth about these passionate, devoted believers.

Imagine instead a group of Christians so captivated by the presence of God that they viewed prayer not as a religious duty but as their very lifeline—like lovers eager for conversation, like children running to a father, like parched travelers discovering an oasis. This is the true heart of Puritan spirituality that we'll explore together.

As Richard Sibbes (1577-1635), one of the gentlest Puritan voices, wrote: "Prayer is the soul's breathing itself into the bosom of its heavenly Father." This image of intimate, life-sustaining communion reveals the essence of how the Puritans approached prayer.

## Beyond the Stereotypes

The Puritans were a movement within Protestant Christianity that emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries. They sought to "purify" the Church of England from what they considered remaining Catholic practices and to deepen personal and corporate spiritual life. 

Far from being the joyless legalists they're often portrayed as, the Puritans were people who:

- Celebrated the goodness of creation while recognizing its fallenness
- Emphasized heartfelt devotion over empty ritual
- Applied theology to everyday life with remarkable practicality
- Balanced deep intellectual engagement with emotional expressiveness
- Viewed all of life—from family relationships to work—as sacred

As J.I. Packer, a modern scholar of Puritanism, notes: "The Puritans were in fact the pioneers of practical, pastoral theology, just as they were the pioneers of evangelical preaching."

## Why Their Approach to Prayer Matters Today

We live in an age of unprecedented distraction. Our attention is fragmented, our schedules overcrowded, and our spirituality often superficial. The Puritans speak directly to our condition, offering timeless wisdom for our modern struggles:

- In our hurried world, they teach us to slow down and truly commune with God
- In our self-sufficient culture, they remind us of our complete dependence on divine grace
- In our distracted age, they demonstrate focused, intentional spiritual practices
- In our emotions-driven society, they show how to engage both heart and mind in prayer

The Puritan approach to prayer wasn't about following rigid formulas but cultivating genuine relationship with God. Their insights cut through the noise of our busy lives with refreshing clarity and depth.

## Meeting Our Puritan Guides

Throughout this book, we'll learn from several Puritan writers. Let me introduce a few of our main guides:

**John Bunyan (1628-1688)** – A tinker by trade who spent twelve years in prison for his faith. His *Pilgrim's Progress* remains one of the most influential Christian books ever written. Bunyan knew prayer as a lifeline in the darkest circumstances.

**John Owen (1616-1683)** – Often considered the greatest Puritan theologian, Owen served as vice-chancellor of Oxford University and wrote extensively on spiritual matters. His penetrating insights into human nature and spiritual struggle remain remarkably relevant.

**Richard Baxter (1615-1691)** – A pastor known for his practical wisdom and tireless care for his congregation. His approach to prayer was grounded in everyday practice and pastoral concerns.

**Thomas Watson (c.1620-1686)** – A master of memorable phrases and illustrations who made profound theological concepts accessible and applicable. His warm, engaging style makes him one of the most readable Puritan authors.

**Matthew Henry (1662-1714)** – While technically from the generation after the Puritans, Henry carried forward their tradition with his practical biblical commentary and prayer guidance.

These writers—and others we'll meet along the way—weren't stuffy academics but pastors, prisoners, and ordinary believers who discovered extraordinary depth in their relationship with God through prayer.

## How This Book Is Organized

This book progresses through the Puritan understanding of prayer in a deliberate sequence:

1. We begin with **the necessity of prayer**—why the Puritans considered it absolutely essential for spiritual life
2. Next, we explore **preparation for prayer**—how they approached the heart condition that precedes effective prayer
3. Then we examine **practical principles for prayer**—their wisdom on how to pray effectively
4. We address **common barriers to prayer**—their guidance for overcoming obstacles we all face
5. We consider **aligning our prayers with God's will**—their insights on praying according to divine purposes
6. We study **biblically grounded prayer**—their methods for allowing Scripture to shape our prayers
7. We learn from **biblical prayer models**—how they found patterns in Bible prayers
8. Finally, we focus on **the Psalms as a prayer manual**—their special emphasis on praying the Psalms

Each chapter includes practical exercises and reflection questions to help you not just understand but apply these rich insights to your own prayer life.

## How to Use This Book

This book is designed to be both informative and transformative—not just teaching about prayer but helping you pray. Here are some suggestions for getting the most from it:

**Read Reflectively**: Take time to pause and consider how the insights connect with your own experience of prayer. The Puritans believed in "meditation"—not emptying the mind but filling it with focused reflection on truth.

**Try the Practices**: Each chapter includes practical exercises drawn from Puritan approaches to prayer. Don't just read about them—experiment with them in your own prayer life.

**Use the Questions**: The reflection questions can deepen your engagement, either for personal journaling or group discussion if you're reading this with others.

**Adapt as Needed**: The Puritans themselves were adaptable, applying timeless principles in ways that fit their context. Feel free to modify their approaches to fit your personality and circumstances.

**Be Patient**: Developing a rich prayer life is a journey, not an instant achievement. The Puritans understood that spiritual growth takes time and consistent practice.

## A Prayer Before We Begin

In the spirit of the Puritans, who often began their works with prayer, let's start our journey with this adapted prayer from Richard Baxter:

> Lord of all grace,
> 
> As we begin this exploration of prayer,
> we acknowledge our need for Your guidance.
> Open our minds to understand,
> our hearts to receive,
> and our wills to respond to the wisdom You gave our forebears.
> 
> May we not merely learn about prayer
> but grow in the practice of prayer.
> May these insights from the past
> bring fresh vitality to our present communion with You.
> 
> Through Jesus Christ, our Mediator and Advocate,
> Amen.
