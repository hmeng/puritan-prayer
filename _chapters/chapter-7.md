## The Art Historian's Discovery

Dr. James Chen stood silently in the Louvre, captivated by Rembrandt's painting, "Moses Breaking the Tablets of the Law." As an art historian specializing in religious artwork, he had studied countless paintings of biblical scenes. Yet something about this particular portrayal of Moses struck him differently today.

"Notice how Rembrandt captures not just Moses' anger," he explained to his graduate student, "but the profound spiritual anguish in his eyes. This isn't merely a historical figure enforcing rules. This is a man who has spoken with God 'face to face, as a man speaks with his friend.'"

Later that evening in his hotel room, James opened his Bible to Exodus 32-33, reading Moses' impassioned prayers after the golden calf incident. Something shifted in his perspective. The biblical prayers were no longer just texts to analyze but windows into the most profound spiritual relationship humans have ever experienced with God.

"These aren't just historical artifacts," he realized. "These are masterclasses in communion with the divine."

This realization—that biblical prayers offer profound insights for our own spiritual lives—was one the Puritans deeply understood. For them, the prayers recorded in Scripture weren't simply historical accounts but living examples to study, understand, and apply.

## The Puritan Approach to Biblical Prayers

The Puritans approached the prayers recorded in Scripture not merely as interesting historical documents but as divinely preserved models for believers in all generations. As Thomas Goodwin (1600-1680) wrote:

> "God caused these prayers to be recorded, not simply to relate a history of what was, but to teach us what should be. They were written for our learning, that we through the pattern of their prayers might have hope and instruction."

Puritan pastors Richard Sibbes and Philip Doddridge particularly emphasized studying biblical prayers, using three key interpretive principles:

1. **Contextual Understanding** – Examining the circumstances that prompted each prayer
2. **Theological Extraction** – Identifying the core theological insights about God and prayer
3. **Contemporary Application** – Adapting these insights to current spiritual needs

In this chapter, we'll explore how the Puritans interpreted and applied three categories of biblical prayer: the intercessory prayers of Moses, the psalmic prayers of David, and the apostolic prayers of Paul.

## Moses: The Intercessor's Prayer

Richard Sibbes (1577-1635), known as "The Heavenly Doctor" for his warm, accessible writings, was particularly drawn to Moses' intercessory prayers. In his work *The Soul's Conflict*, Sibbes highlights Moses as the model intercessor who stands between God and His people.

### Lessons from Moses' Prayer After the Golden Calf (Exodus 32:11-14)

When Israel fell into idolatry with the golden calf, Moses interceded with a prayer that Sibbes called "a masterpiece of holy argumentation." Let's examine Sibbes' insights into this remarkable prayer:

#### 1. Appealing to God's Investment

> "O LORD, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, whom you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?" (Exodus 32:11)

Sibbes noted how Moses reminded God of His own investment in Israel:

> "Moses doth not merely beg mercy, but grounds his plea on God's prior works. He reminds the Lord, as it were, 'These are the people into whom Thou hast already invested so much of Thy power and name.'"

**Puritan Application**: Sibbes encouraged believers to remind God in prayer of His ongoing investment in their lives:

> "In times of greatest desert and distance from God, plead not what you deserve but what He has already done. Say to Him, 'Lord, I am Thy servant in whom Thou hast already glorified Thy grace and mercy; wilt Thou now forsake the work of Thine own hands?'"

**Contemporary Insight**: This principle transforms how we pray during spiritual dry periods or after failures. Instead of wondering if God has abandoned us, we can remind ourselves (and God) of His prior investment in our salvation and spiritual growth.

**Practical Exercise**: Write a prayer that follows Moses' pattern, beginning each paragraph with "Remember, Lord, how You have..." List specific ways God has already demonstrated His commitment to you.

#### 2. Concern for God's Reputation

> "Why should the Egyptians say, 'With evil intent did he bring them out, to kill them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth'? Turn from your burning anger and relent from this disaster against your people." (Exodus 32:12)

Sibbes was struck by Moses' concern for God's reputation among the nations:

> "Here is no self-interest, but rather a holy jealousy for God's name. Moses pleads not primarily for the people's sake but for the glory of God among the heathen. The truly spiritual man in prayer rises above private concerns to God's greater purpose."

**Puritan Application**: Sibbes taught that mature prayer extends beyond personal needs to concern for God's kingdom purposes:

> "If you would pray like Moses, let your chief argument be, 'Lord, what will the world say? How will Thy great name suffer if Thy church and cause be ruined?' This touches the Lord at the heart when we plead for His glory's sake."

**Contemporary Insight**: This challenges our often self-centered prayers. When facing trials, we can expand our perspective by asking how God might be glorified through our situation rather than simply praying for relief.

**Group Discussion Question**: How might our prayers change if we regularly asked, "How could God's reputation be affected by this situation?" before presenting our requests?

#### 3. Standing on God's Promises

> "Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, 'I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.'" (Exodus 32:13)

Sibbes highlighted Moses' appeal to God's covenant promises:

> "Moses binds God with His own word. He pleads not human merit but divine promise. This is the strongest ground of prayer—to hold God to what He has bound Himself to by promise."

**Puritan Application**: Sibbes advised believers to study God's promises so they could pray them back to Him:

> "Search the Scriptures for God's promises, turn them into prayers, and bind the Lord with His own word. Say to Him, 'Lord, Thou canst not deny Thyself; Thou canst not forget Thy covenant.'"

**Contemporary Insight**: This reveals prayer as not merely asking for what we want but claiming what God has already promised. The question shifts from "Will God give me what I want?" to "How do God's promises apply to this situation?"

**Practical Application**: Create a "promise inventory" by categorizing biblical promises related to different areas of life (salvation, guidance, provision, etc.). When praying about a specific need, first search your inventory for relevant promises.

### Lessons from Moses' Prayer for God's Presence (Exodus 33:12-23)

Philip Doddridge (1702-1751), following the Puritan tradition, was fascinated by Moses' bold request to see God's glory. In his *Family Expositor*, Doddridge highlighted several principles from this extraordinary prayer:

#### 1. Establishing Relationship as the Foundation

> "Moses said to the LORD, 'See, you say to me, "Bring up this people," but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, "I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight."'" (Exodus 33:12)

Doddridge noted how Moses begins by affirming his personal relationship with God:

> "Before making his great request, Moses reminds God of the special relationship they share. He stands on the ground not of his own merit but of God's freely given favor. This is ever the right foundation for bold prayer."

**Puritan Application**: Doddridge taught that confidence in prayer comes not from personal worthiness but from God's established relationship with us:

> "Come to God in prayer as one whom He knows by name. Not as a stranger, not as a slave, but as a friend, as one already received into His favor through the merit of Christ. This will give holy boldness when asking great things."

**Contemporary Insight**: Before presenting specific requests, we benefit from consciously affirming our relationship with God through Christ. This shifts our approach from tentative petitioning to confident asking.

**Practical Step**: Begin prayer times by taking 1-2 minutes to consciously affirm your identity in Christ and God's commitment to you before presenting specific requests.

#### 2. Praying for God Himself, Not Just His Benefits

> "Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me now your ways, that I may know you in order to find favor in your sight." (Exodus 33:13)

Doddridge was struck by Moses' primary request—not for success or ease, but for deeper knowledge of God:

> "Moses shows us prayer's highest aim. He asks not primarily for success in his mission, though that was important, but for deeper knowledge of God Himself. His greatest desire was not God's gifts but God's ways—His character, His nature, His methods."

**Puritan Application**: Doddridge encouraged believers to examine their prayers for signs of spiritual maturity:

> "The surest sign of growth in grace is when your prayers shift from seeking only God's blessings to seeking principally His presence. Ask yourself: Would I be content if God granted all my requests but gave me no deeper experience of Himself?"

**Contemporary Insight**: This challenges us to examine whether we're seeking God primarily for who He is or for what He can do for us. Mature prayer includes asking for tangible needs but prioritizes spiritual intimacy.

**Self-Examination**: Review your recent prayers. What percentage focused on receiving God's benefits versus experiencing God Himself? How might you adjust this balance?

#### 3. Refusing to Proceed Without God's Presence

> "And he said to him, 'If your presence will not go with me, do not bring us up from here.'" (Exodus 33:15)

Doddridge highlighted Moses' remarkable stance:

> "Here is a prayer of holy stubbornness! Moses essentially says, 'Better to remain in the wilderness with God than enter the Promised Land without Him.' He recognized that success without God's presence would be the greatest failure."

**Puritan Application**: Doddridge warned against settling for worldly success without spiritual intimacy:

> "Learn from Moses to make this your constant prayer: 'Lord, let me have nothing that would separate me from Thee; give me no advancement, no comfort, no success if Thy presence goes not with me.'"

**Contemporary Insight**: In our success-oriented culture, Moses' prayer offers a radical reordering of priorities. It suggests that the primary question isn't "Will this endeavor succeed?" but "Will God be present in this endeavor?"

**Practical Exercise**: Before major decisions, try praying Moses' prayer verbatim: "If your presence will not go with me, do not send me up from here." Note how this perspective affects your decision-making process.

## David: The Emotional Honesty of Psalmic Prayer

Thomas Manton (1620-1677) and John Owen (1616-1683) both wrote extensively on the Psalms, seeing them as divinely inspired prayer templates. While acknowledging the unique circumstances of David's life, they believed the emotional and spiritual patterns revealed in the Psalms were universally applicable.

### Lessons from David's Prayer of Repentance (Psalm 51)

After David's sin with Bathsheba, his prayer of repentance in Psalm 51 offers profound insights on approaching God after moral failure. Thomas Manton drew several principles from this psalm:

#### 1. Appealing to God's Character Rather Than Personal Merit

> "Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions." (Psalm 51:1)

Manton noted how David begins not with excuses but with an appeal to God's nature:

> "David doth not plead his own deservings, but God's free grace. He doth not say, 'Lord, pardon me because I have done worthily in times past,' but 'according to thy loving-kindness.' This is the right way of addressing ourselves to God."

**Puritan Application**: Manton taught believers to ground confession in God's character:

> "When confessing sin, look not to the smallness of your sin but to the greatness of God's mercy. Look not to your repentance, though that must be present, but to Christ's intercession and God's covenant. These are the grounds of true comfort."

**Contemporary Insight**: This approach transforms confession from a shameful experience to a hopeful one. Rather than wondering if our repentance is sufficient, we rest on God's established character and promises regarding forgiveness.

**Practical Step**: When confessing sin, explicitly acknowledge God's attributes that relate to forgiveness (mercy, grace, faithfulness) before asking for pardon.

#### 2. Complete Transparency About Sin

> "For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me. Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight." (Psalm 51:3-4a)

Manton emphasized David's refusal to minimize his offenses:

> "David does not hide his sin with excuses, nor cast the blame on others, nor speak of his transgression in general terms, nor balance it with his good actions. He makes a full, free, and particular confession, sparing neither his sin nor himself."

**Puritan Application**: Manton cautioned against partial confession:

> "Beware of confessing sin by halves. Many will acknowledge their sin in general terms but flinch when it comes to particulars. Or they will confess the sin, but hide the aggravations. This is to cover sin, not to confess it."

**Contemporary Insight**: Modern therapeutic approaches confirm the psychological value of complete transparency. Both spiritually and psychologically, healing begins with full acknowledgment of wrongdoing.

**Personal Exercise**: Practice "aggravation-aware confession" by acknowledging not just the sin itself but the specific circumstances that made it more serious (impact on others, prior knowledge, position of trust, etc.).

#### 3. Seeking Transformation, Not Just Forgiveness

> "Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me." (Psalm 51:10)

Manton highlighted David's desire for inner transformation:

> "Mark how David prays not only for pardon of sin but for purging of sin. Many would have God overlook their sin, but are not concerned to have it overcome. David's prayer reaches both to justification and sanctification."

**Puritan Application**: Manton taught that genuine repentance includes desire for holiness:

> "It is a sign of true repentance when we are as earnest with God for mortifying sin as for removing guilt. The true penitent hates the sin itself more than the punishment."

**Contemporary Insight**: This contrasts with the modern tendency to seek relief from guilt feelings without necessarily desiring character transformation. David's prayer reminds us that forgiveness is not the end goal but the beginning of renewed living.

**Journaling Prompt**: For a recent sin you've confessed, write a brief prayer following David's pattern—first asking forgiveness, then specifically requesting transformation in that area.

### Lessons from David's Prayer of Lament (Psalm 13)

John Owen, in his "Exposition of the Hebrews," drew attention to the psalmists' pattern of honest lament followed by renewed trust. Psalm 13 exemplifies this movement:

#### 1. Permission for Sacred Complaint

> "How long, O LORD? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?" (Psalm 13:1)

Owen observed the boldness of David's complaint:

> "The psalmist does not begin with stoic resignation but with honest distress. Yet note that his complaint is directed to God, not about God to others. This makes it prayer rather than mere grumbling."

**Puritan Application**: Owen distinguished between sinful complaint and sacred lament:

> "There is a complaining to God that honors Him, showing our dependence and desire for His intervention. And there is a complaining against God that dishonors Him, questioning His wisdom and goodness. Learn to practice the former and avoid the latter."

**Contemporary Insight**: Modern believers often feel pressure to maintain positive language in prayer, avoiding expressions of frustration or pain. The psalms legitimize bringing raw emotions to God as an act of trust rather than disrespect.

**Practical Guidance**: When experiencing spiritual darkness, try beginning prayer with "How long, O Lord?" followed by specific articulation of your struggle. Note how this differs from complaining about God to others.

#### 2. The Movement from Feeling to Faith

Psalm 13 begins with distress but ends with declaration of trust:

> "But I have trusted in your steadfast love; my heart shall rejoice in your salvation." (Psalm 13:5)

Owen noted this deliberate movement:

> "The psalm shows us that prayer is not merely for expressing feelings but for transforming them. David begins where he is emotionally but does not end there. Through prayer, he reminds himself of God's proven character and promises."

**Puritan Application**: Owen encouraged believers to use prayer to redirect their emotions:

> "In time of darkness, begin your prayer with your present feelings, but do not end there. Deliberately recount God's faithfulness and promises until your heart begins to move from complaint to confidence."

**Contemporary Insight**: This addresses the common question of whether we should pray when we don't feel like it. The psalms suggest that honest prayer is precisely the remedy for spiritual dryness—not starting with artificial positivity but moving intentionally toward trust.

**Practical Exercise**: For a current struggle, write a brief "Psalm 13-style" prayer with two parts: first honestly expressing your feelings, then deliberately stating truths about God that speak to your situation.

## Paul: The Theological Depth of Apostolic Prayer

Thomas Goodwin, in his exposition of Ephesians, devoted significant attention to Paul's prayers, seeing them as revelations of mature prayer priorities.

### Lessons from Paul's Prayer for the Ephesians (Ephesians 1:15-23)

Goodwin was particularly struck by what Paul did not pray for—physical health, relief from persecution, or material provision—focusing instead on spiritual knowledge and power.

#### 1. Praying for Spiritual Insight Above Material Comfort

> "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him, having the eyes of your hearts enlightened..." (Ephesians 1:17-18a)

Goodwin observed:

> "Mark what the apostle prays for—not that their earthly troubles might cease, though these were many, but that their spiritual understanding might increase. He knew that if they saw Christ more clearly, they could endure hardship more cheerfully."

**Puritan Application**: Goodwin encouraged believers to elevate spiritual requests in their prayers:

> "Let the apostle's prayer check and guide yours. How often do we pray earnestly for what concerns our earthly comfort but coldly for what concerns our spiritual growth! This shows our values are inverted from the apostle's."

**Contemporary Insight**: This challenges our tendency to focus prayer requests on health, finances, and relationships while neglecting spiritual development. Paul's prayer suggests that knowing God better is more important than improved circumstances.

**Practical Reframing**: For each material need currently on your prayer list, identify a related spiritual need. For example, alongside "healing from illness," add "deeper experience of God's comfort"; alongside "financial provision," add "greater trust in God's faithfulness."

#### 2. Praying with Theological Precision

> "That you may know... what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his great might that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead..." (Ephesians 1:18b-20a)

Goodwin highlighted the theological specificity of Paul's prayer:

> "Paul does not pray merely for 'power' in general terms but connects it precisely to the resurrection power that operated in Christ. His prayer is thoroughly informed by his theology, making it both precise and potent."

**Puritan Application**: Goodwin taught that effective prayer requires theological understanding:

> "Study the attributes and works of God so you may pray to Him as He truly is, not as you imagine Him to be. General prayers spring from general and indistinct knowledge; particular and powerful prayers flow from clear apprehensions of God's nature and ways."

**Contemporary Insight**: This suggests that theological study is not an academic exercise separate from prayer but actually enhances prayer. Understanding who God is and how He works allows for more specific, confident prayer.

**Suggested Practice**: Before praying about a specific need, take 5 minutes to identify 2-3 theological truths (about God's nature, Christ's work, or the Spirit's role) that relate directly to that need.

#### 3. Praying for What God Already Intends to Give

> "I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers..." (Ephesians 1:16)

Goodwin noted that Paul prayed for things God had already promised:

> "Some might ask, 'Why pray for what God has already purposed to give?' Yet Paul understands that God's sovereign purposes do not eliminate the need for prayer but establish the certainty of its efficacy."

**Puritan Application**: Goodwin explained that God's promises should inspire rather than discourage prayer:

> "Let God's declared purposes be the encouragement of your prayers, not the discouragement. Those things God has determined to give, He has generally determined to give in answer to prayer."

**Contemporary Insight**: This addresses the common question about whether prayer "changes things" if God is sovereign. The Puritan understanding was that prayer doesn't alter God's purposes but is the means by which those purposes are frequently accomplished.

**Practical Approach**: Review biblical passages about God's intentions for believers (spiritual growth, sanctification, conformity to Christ). Make these declared divine purposes the substance of your regular prayers.

## Practical Methods for Praying Biblical Prayers

Drawing from Puritan insights, here are structured approaches to incorporating biblical prayers into your own prayer life:

### 1. The Personal Adaptation Method

**Purpose**: To personalize scriptural prayers for your own circumstances

**Method**:
1. Select a biblical prayer that relates to your current situation
2. Read it slowly, noting its structure and key elements
3. Identify the timeless principles embedded in the specific request
4. Rewrite the prayer using these principles but applying them to your situation
5. Pray this personalized adaptation, keeping the biblical pattern but addressing your specific needs

**Example**: Adapt Paul's prayer in Colossians 1:9-12 for a friend facing difficult workplace decisions.

**Time Required**: 15-20 minutes

### 2. The Prayer Study Approach

**Purpose**: To learn the prayer priorities of biblical figures

**Method**:
1. Choose a biblical character known for prayer (Moses, David, Jesus, Paul)
2. Identify 3-4 of their recorded prayers
3. Create a chart noting:
   - What they asked for most frequently
   - How they addressed God
   - What scriptural truths they referenced
   - How they concluded their prayers
4. Compare these patterns with your own prayer habits
5. Create a plan to incorporate one new biblical prayer pattern into your practice

**Puritan Connection**: This analytical approach to prayer was recommended by Richard Baxter in his *Christian Directory*.

**Time Required**: 30-45 minutes

### 3. The Circumstantial Parallel Method

**Purpose**: To find biblical prayers that match your current circumstances

**Method**:
1. Identify your current situation or need (e.g., temptation, direction, opposition)
2. Find a biblical character who faced similar circumstances
3. Study how they prayed in that situation
4. Note both the content of their prayer and its outcome
5. Adapt their approach to your specific context

**Example**: If facing opposition, study Nehemiah's prayers when confronted by opponents (Nehemiah 4:4-5, 6:9).

**Time Required**: 15-20 minutes initially, then 5-10 minutes daily

### 4. The "But Then..." Psalm Method

**Purpose**: To move from honest complaint to faith affirmation

**Method**:
1. Select a psalm that follows the pattern of lament-to-praise (e.g., Psalms 13, 42, 73)
2. Write a prayer with two sections:
   - "I feel" section – honestly expressing your current struggles
   - "But then" section – deliberately shifting to affirm truths about God
3. Pray this written prayer aloud
4. Note any emotional shift that occurs during this process

**Puritan Connection**: John Owen specifically recommended this approach for times of spiritual darkness.

**Time Required**: 10-15 minutes

## Exercises for Praying Biblical Prayers

### Exercise 1: Praying with Moses' Boldness

**Purpose**: To practice intercession that appeals to God's character and promises

**Method**:
1. Identify a situation requiring intercession (family, church, nation)
2. Study Moses' prayer in Exodus 32:11-14
3. Write a prayer following Moses' pattern:
   - Remind God of His past work in the situation
   - Appeal to His reputation and name
   - Stand on His specific promises
4. Pray this prayer daily for one week

**Expected Outcome**: Greater confidence in intercessory prayer based on God's character rather than human merit.

**Time Required**: 20 minutes preparation, then 5 minutes daily

### Exercise 2: Praying with David's Honesty

**Purpose**: To practice emotional transparency with God

**Method**:
1. Select a psalm that expresses an emotion you're currently experiencing
2. Read it aloud, pausing after each verse
3. Write a brief personal response to each verse
4. Combine these responses into a cohesive prayer
5. Pray this composite, noting any shift in perspective

**Group Variation**: In small groups, assign different psalms expressing various emotions. Have each person share what they learned about bringing that emotion honestly to God.

**Time Required**: 15-20 minutes

### Exercise 3: Praying with Paul's Theological Depth

**Purpose**: To incorporate theological truths into prayer

**Method**:
1. Select one of Paul's prayers (Ephesians 1:15-23, Ephesians 3:14-21, Philippians 1:9-11, Colossians 1:9-14)
2. Identify the theological concepts embedded in the prayer
3. Research any concepts you don't fully understand
4. Create a prayer list based on these theological priorities
5. Pray for yourself and others using this theologically rich list

**Suggested Application**: Pray this way for your church leadership weekly.

**Time Required**: 30 minutes preparation, then 10 minutes daily

## Reflection Questions

1. Which biblical prayer figure—Moses, David, or Paul—do you most naturally resonate with in your own prayer life? Which seems most foreign to your typical approach?

2. The Puritans believed biblical prayers revealed God's priorities for prayer. Where do you see the greatest differences between these priorities and those of contemporary Christians?

3. Moses boldly reminded God of His own character and promises. How comfortable are you with this approach? Does it seem presumptuous or appropriately confident?

4. David's psalms often begin with raw emotional honesty before moving toward trust. How might this pattern help those who either suppress their negative emotions or remain stuck in them?

5. Paul's prayers focus primarily on spiritual growth rather than material provision or comfort. How might adopting this priority change your church's prayer ministry or your personal prayer lists?

## A Prayer Inspired by Biblical Patterns

> Sovereign Lord,
> 
> Like Moses, we remind You of Your covenant faithfulness—
> that You have promised never to leave or forsake Your people,
> and that Your name and glory are at stake in the fulfillment of Your purposes.
> We stand not on our own worthiness but on Your unchanging character.
> 
> Like David, we bring our honest hearts before You—
> our questions, our pain, our confusion, even our anger.
> Yet we refuse to end our prayer in despair,
> choosing instead to remember Your steadfast love
> that has sustained us through every trial before this one.
> 
> Like Paul, we ask not merely for comfort and ease,
> but for spiritual sight to perceive Your glory,
> spiritual strength to endure with patience,
> and spiritual wisdom to understand Your ways.
> 
> Grant us the boldness of Moses,
> the emotional honesty of David,
> and the theological depth of Paul
> as we continue to learn the art of prayer
> from those who have spoken with You before us.
> 
> Through Jesus Christ, our ultimate intercessor,
> who ever lives to make intercession for us. Amen.

**Next Chapter**: *The Psalms as a Prayer Manual* - We'll explore the Puritans' special relationship with the Psalms as the divinely inspired prayer book, with insights from John Owen and Isaac Watts on how to use the Psalms for a vibrant prayer life.
