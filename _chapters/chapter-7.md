## Learning from the Masters of Prayer

Who better to teach us how to pray than those whose prayers are recorded in Scripture itself? The Bible presents a rich gallery of prayer warriors—men and women who approached God with boldness, honesty, reverence, and faith. Their prayers, preserved by divine inspiration, offer us models worth studying and emulating.

The Puritans were avid students of biblical prayers. They didn't simply read these prayers; they analyzed them, memorized them, and used them as templates for their own conversations with God. They recognized that Scripture not only commands us to pray but shows us how.

This chapter explores Puritan interpretations of the prayers of three biblical figures: Moses, whose intimate dialogue with God shaped a nation; David, whose emotionally rich prayers span the full range of human experience; and Paul, whose theologically profound petitions reveal God's priorities for his people. From each, we can glean valuable lessons to enrich our own prayer lives.

## Moses: Prayers of Holy Boldness and Intercession

Moses stands as one of the most remarkable prayer warriors in Scripture. His conversations with God range from hesitant objections at the burning bush to face-to-face dialogue "as a man speaks with his friend" (Exodus 33:11). The Puritans found his prayer life particularly instructive.

### 1. Prayer as Divine Dialogue

Thomas Goodwin (1600-1680), reflecting on Moses' encounters with God, emphasized the dialogical nature of prayer:

> "Moses reasoned with God, and God with him, and yielded up himself to be overcome by Moses... There is no man who knows the ways of prayer, but he finds God coming in with light and revelations of himself, even when he least expected them."

For Goodwin, Moses' example showed that prayer isn't merely offering petitions—it's engaging in a genuine conversation where both parties speak, listen, and respond.

**Reflection Question**: How balanced is your prayer life between speaking and listening? What practices might help you develop the listening side of your prayer conversation with God?

### 2. Holy Boldness in Intercession

Richard Sibbes (1577-1635) was particularly moved by Moses' intercession for Israel after their idolatry with the golden calf (Exodus 32), where Moses essentially stood between God's judgment and the people:

> "God loves to be overcome with strength of prayer. When Jacob wrestled, he overcame; and the woman of Canaan, she would have no denial. This honor God gives his children, that he will suffer them to be prevailers with him."

The Puritans saw Moses' boldness not as presumption but as faith-filled engagement with God's revealed character—particularly His mercy and covenant faithfulness.

**Biblical Study**: Read Exodus 32:7-14. Note how Moses appeals to:
- God's investment in Israel's redemption (v. 11)
- God's reputation among the nations (v. 12)
- God's promises to the patriarchs (v. 13)

**Application Practice**: Choose a situation requiring intercession (perhaps for your family, church, or nation). Following Moses' pattern, craft a prayer that respectfully appeals to God's character, work, and promises.

### 3. Hunger for God's Presence

John Owen found profound significance in Moses' request to see God's glory (Exodus 33:18), seeing it as the ultimate prayer that should underlie all others:

> "This is the first and principal thing that any person who would justify themselves before God will earnestly seek after—a discovery of the glory of God. So did Moses here, and so did others elsewhere."

For Owen, Moses exemplified a prayer life driven not primarily by requests for divine interventions but by hunger for divine presence.

**Heart Examination**: Consider your primary motivation in prayer. Are you more focused on what God can do for you, or on experiencing God Himself? How might your prayers change if seeing God's glory became your central desire?

### 4. The Puritan Practice of "Wrestling Prayer"

Inspired by Moses' persistent intercession, the Puritans developed what they called "wrestling prayer"—extended, earnest engagement with God over significant concerns. William Gurnall described this practice:

> "Wrestling prayer comes from a heart in great earnest... When the spirit of prayer works in the soul, it is like a spring in a watch, which sets all wheels—the affections—in motion."

**Guided Exercise in Wrestling Prayer**:
1. Set aside 30-45 minutes of uninterrupted time
2. Begin with Scripture reading that relates to your concern
3. Present your request to God with specific details
4. Like Moses, appeal to relevant aspects of God's character and promises
5. When distractions come, gently return to your focus
6. Continue until you sense a release or resolution in your spirit

## David: The Full Emotional Range of Prayer

No biblical figure expresses a wider emotional range in prayer than David. From exuberant praise to bitter lament, from confident faith to desperate pleading, the prayers of David (particularly in the Psalms) demonstrate that we can bring our whole selves before God.

### 1. Emotional Honesty in Prayer

Richard Baxter (1615-1691) encouraged believers to learn from David's emotional transparency:

> "David was a man after God's own heart, not because he was without fault, but because his heart was without guile in his prayers. He poured out his very soul to God, hiding nothing of his condition."

The Puritans rejected the notion that proper prayer requires emotional restraint. Instead, following David's example, they advocated bringing raw emotional honesty before God.

**Emotional Prayer Inventory**: Which emotions do you typically express in prayer, and which do you tend to suppress? Consider whether you've developed an artificial "prayer voice" that edits out certain feelings. How might David's example encourage greater authenticity?

### 2. The Movement from Lament to Trust

Thomas Brooks (1608-1680) observed a common pattern in David's prayers of lament—they typically begin with honest complaint but progress toward expressions of trust:

> "The psalmist begins many of his psalms with tears but ends them with triumphs. His tune alters. He begins with sorrows but concludes with joys."

Brooks saw this pattern as instructive for believers facing difficulty. David didn't deny his pain, but he didn't remain there either—he moved toward trust, often through the very act of prayer itself.

**Structural Exercise**: Using Psalm 13 as a model, write a prayer following David's pattern:
1. Begin with honest questions or complaints (vv. 1-2)
2. Present your specific requests (vv. 3-4)
3. Make a deliberate choice to trust (vv. 5-6)
4. End with praise, even before seeing the answer

### 3. Prayer Emerging from Life Experience

Matthew Henry (1662-1714) noted how David's prayers were deeply connected to his life circumstances—whether hiding in caves, leading armies, or confronting his own moral failures:

> "David's prayers and praises were the very breathings of his soul toward God, the issue of a living principle of devotion... His prayers were his journal... his affections toward God, which are the life and soul of prayer."

For Henry, David's example teaches us to make prayer an organic extension of our daily experiences rather than a separate religious compartment.

**Integration Practice**: For one week, try "praying your day"—bringing ordinary experiences into conversation with God as they occur. At day's end, reflect: How does this integration of prayer with daily life compare to more formal, separated prayer times?

### 4. The Prayer of Repentance

John Owen drew profound lessons from David's prayer of repentance in Psalm 51, following his sins of adultery and murder:

> "David's prayer for pardon contains in it more than mere desire of freedom from wrath. It carries in it the whole work of regeneration."

Owen observed that true repentance, as modeled by David, involves not just asking for forgiveness but seeking inner transformation.

**Elements of Biblical Repentance**: Study Psalm 51 to identify these elements in David's prayer:
- Acknowledgment of specific sin (v. 3-4)
- Recognition of inward corruption (v. 5-6)
- Desire for cleansing and renewal (v. 7-12)
- Commitment to changed behavior (v. 13-15)
- Understanding that external actions aren't sufficient (v. 16-17)

**Personal Application**: If there's an area requiring repentance in your life, craft a prayer using David's pattern. Be specific about the sin, honest about its roots, and clear about your desire for transformation.

## Paul: Theologically Rich and Kingdom-Focused Prayer

The Apostle Paul's prayers, recorded primarily in his epistles, offer a profound model of theologically informed intercession. The Puritans were particularly drawn to Paul's prayers because they so clearly align with God's redemptive purposes.

### 1. The God-Centered Nature of Paul's Prayers

Thomas Manton (1620-1677) observed that Paul's prayers typically begin with contemplation of God's character and works:

> "The apostle usually begins his prayers with some honorable mention of God... This method is exactly suitable to the nature of the duty. We must first act faith and then love... first view the goodness of God, then delight in Him and praise Him."

Manton saw in Paul a pattern worth emulating—rooting prayer in theological truth rather than immediate needs.

**Structure Analysis**: Study the opening of Paul's prayers in Ephesians 1:3-14, Philippians 1:3-6, and Colossians 1:3-8. Note how each begins with theological affirmation before moving to petition.

**Application Principle**: Begin your own prayers with conscious reflection on who God is and what He has done, allowing these truths to shape your subsequent requests.

### 2. Praying for Spiritual Growth

John Flavel (1628-1691) highlighted how Paul's prayers focused predominantly on spiritual rather than material concerns:

> "The apostle prays for the best of blessings... not that God might make them rich in the world, but rich in spiritual things. The carnal mind chiefly refers to outward prosperity; the renewed mind to spiritual blessings."

Flavel and other Puritans noted how Paul's prayers in Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians reveal God's priorities for believers—not primarily comfort or success but knowledge, holiness, and love.

**Prayer Priorities Assessment**: Review your recent prayer requests. What percentage focused on external circumstances versus internal spiritual growth? How might Paul's example reshape your prayer priorities?

**Guided Prayer Experiment**: For one week, structure your intercessory prayers after Paul's pattern in Ephesians 1:15-23 and 3:14-21, focusing primarily on spiritual growth for those you normally pray for. Notice how this shift affects both your prayers and your perspective.

### 3. The Corporate Dimension of Prayer

Richard Sibbes observed that Paul rarely prayed for individuals in isolation, but typically for communities of believers:

> "The apostle prays not only for himself but enlarges his heart for the whole church... True Christians have public spirits, watching all opportunities for the common good."

The Puritans, following Paul, understood prayer as a community-forming practice that strengthens the bonds of Christian fellowship.

**Community Prayer Practice**: Identify a group you're connected to (family, small group, church). Create a prayer inspired by Paul's prayer in Philippians 1:9-11 or Colossians 1:9-14, tailored to this specific community's current circumstances and needs.

### 4. Praying from a Gospel Framework

John Owen found in Paul's prayers a consistent gospel framework—prayers shaped by the story of Christ's incarnation, death, resurrection, and coming return:

> "The apostle's prayers are built upon and directed by evangelical revelations... They flow from and lead to truths made known in the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ."

For Owen, Paul modeled how Christian prayer differs from general religious prayer—it is specifically shaped by the person and work of Christ.

**Gospel-Centered Prayer Exercise**: Choose a current concern or request. Before praying about it, consider:
- How does Christ's life, death, and resurrection relate to this situation?
- What gospel promises pertain to this need?
- How might this request advance Christ's kingdom?

Then pray from this gospel-informed perspective.

## Applying Biblical Prayer Patterns to Contemporary Needs

The Puritans didn't merely analyze biblical prayers academically—they actively applied these patterns to the concerns of their day. Similarly, we can adapt the prayer approaches of Moses, David, and Paul to address our contemporary needs.

### 1. Modern Applications of Moses' Intercessory Prayer

Moses interceded for Israel in times of national crisis and potential judgment. His pattern provides a framework for praying about larger social and political concerns:

**For Social Divisions**:
"Lord, you have brought people of different backgrounds together in this nation/community/church. Don't let the enemy have victory through our divisions. Remember your purposes for unity in Christ and your heart for reconciliation. Guide leaders to foster understanding and healing rather than exploitation of differences."

**For Moral and Spiritual Decline**:
"Father, we have turned from your ways to follow idols of materialism, pleasure, and self-determination. Yet you have invested generations of faithfulness in this nation/community. For the sake of your name among the nations and in remembrance of your covenant promises to our spiritual ancestors, bring revival and reformation."

### 2. Contemporary Applications of David's Emotional Prayers

David's prayers provide patterns for processing personal and emotional challenges:

**For Mental Health Struggles**:
"How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever? My mind is filled with anxious thoughts, and my spirit is overwhelmed within me. Consider and answer me, I pray. Bring light to my darkness, stability to my thoughts, and peace to my heart. Despite these struggles, I will trust in your unfailing love; my heart rejoices in your salvation."

**For Relational Wounds**:
"God, I feel betrayed by someone I trusted [specific details]. The pain cuts deeply, and I struggle with thoughts of resentment. Vindicate me in your time and way. Meanwhile, search my heart and show me if there's any offensive way in me. Lead me in healing and in your everlasting way."

### 3. Modern Applications of Paul's Kingdom-Focused Prayers

Paul's prayers offer templates for intercession that aligns with God's larger purposes:

**For the Digital Age Church**:
"Father of glory, give your church the Spirit of wisdom and revelation to navigate this digital age with integrity and purpose. May the eyes of our hearts be enlightened to see how technology can serve your mission rather than distract from it. Strengthen us to resist digital idolatry and isolation, instead using these tools to advance your kingdom and deepen authentic community."

**For Christian Leaders Under Pressure**:
"I pray that you would strengthen them with power through your Spirit in their inner being. Ground them deeply in Christ's love when organizational demands and cultural pressures mount. Fill them with wisdom to distinguish between urgent and important, between pleasing people and serving your purposes. May they lead not from anxiety or ambition but from the fullness of God at work within them."

## Identifying Structure and Elements in Biblical Prayers

The Puritans were careful students of the structure and elements that comprise biblical prayers. By recognizing these patterns, we can build a more effective framework for our own prayers.

### 1. Common Structural Elements

The Puritans identified several structural components that appear consistently in biblical prayers:

#### Invocation: Addressing God Appropriately

Biblical prayers typically begin by addressing God in ways that relate to the prayer's content—calling upon aspects of His character relevant to the request:
- Moses appeals to God as covenant-keeper when interceding for Israel (Exodus 32:13)
- David addresses God as "my rock" when seeking strength (Psalm 18:2)
- Paul addresses the "Father of glory" when praying for spiritual enlightenment (Ephesians 1:17)

**Application**: Begin your prayers by consciously addressing God in ways relevant to your request, focusing your attention on the specific aspects of His character that pertain to your need.

#### Adoration: Declaring God's Character and Works

Many biblical prayers include explicit praise or acknowledgment of God's attributes and actions:
- Moses: "The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God..." (Exodus 34:6-7)
- David: "I will extol the LORD at all times; his praise will always be on my lips" (Psalm 34:1)
- Paul: "Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ..." (Ephesians 1:3)

**Application**: Include specific statements of God's character and works in your prayers, especially those relevant to your current circumstances.

#### Petition: Making Specific Requests

Biblical prayers typically move from acknowledging God to making specific requests:
- Moses: "Teach me your ways so I may know you..." (Exodus 33:13)
- David: "Create in me a pure heart, O God..." (Psalm 51:10)
- Paul: "I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ...may give you the Spirit of wisdom..." (Ephesians 1:17)

**Application**: After focusing on God's character, present specific rather than vague requests, expressing exactly what you're asking God to do.

#### Commitment: Responding to God's Answer

Many biblical prayers conclude with expressions of trust, commitment, or intended response:
- Moses: "If your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here" (Exodus 33:15)
- David: "Then I will teach transgressors your ways..." (Psalm 51:13)
- Paul: "To him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations" (Ephesians 3:21)

**Application**: Conclude prayers with statements of trust in God's wisdom, commitments to act on His guidance, or expressions of praise for His anticipated work.

### 2. Exercises in Identifying Prayer Patterns

The Puritans would often analyze biblical prayers to learn from their structure. Here are exercises to develop this skill:

#### The Narrative Prayer Analysis

Select a narrative prayer from Scripture (such as Hannah's prayer in 1 Samuel 2, Hezekiah's prayer in Isaiah 38, or Jesus' prayer in John 17):
1. Identify the context and circumstances that prompted the prayer
2. Note how the prayer begins and what aspects of God it emphasizes
3. Identify the main request or purpose of the prayer
4. Observe any supporting arguments or appeals made
5. Note how the prayer concludes
6. Consider how this pattern might apply to similar circumstances in your life

#### The Pauline Prayer Outline

Take one of Paul's prayers (such as Ephesians 1:15-23, Philippians 1:9-11, or Colossians 1:9-14):
1. Write out each distinct request or petition
2. Note any supporting theological statements
3. Identify the relationships between the requests (do some build on others?)
4. Observe the ultimate goals or outcomes Paul seeks
5. Create a prayer outline based on this structure that you can adapt for various situations

## Practice in Praying Like Biblical Figures

As we conclude this chapter, here are several guided exercises to help you apply what you've learned from biblical prayer patterns:

### 1. Praying Like Moses: Intercessory Prayer

Choose a situation requiring bold intercession (for your church, community, or nation):
1. Begin by acknowledging God's past work and investment in this group
2. Appeal to His character—His mercy, faithfulness, or stated purposes
3. Like Moses, respectfully reason with God based on His promises
4. Conclude with surrender to His wisdom and timing

### 2. Praying Like David: Processing Emotional Reality

Select a situation causing strong emotions (whether positive or negative):
1. Begin with honest expression of your emotions, holding nothing back
2. Connect your experience to theological truth about God
3. Make specific requests related to your situation
4. Conclude with a deliberate choice to trust God regardless of circumstances
5. End with praise or thanksgiving, even before seeing resolution

### 3. Praying Like Paul: Kingdom-Focused Intercession

Choose several people to pray for (family members, friends, coworkers):
1. Begin with thanksgiving for specific evidence of God's work in their lives
2. Pray primarily for their spiritual growth and development
3. Request specific spiritual qualities (wisdom, discernment, love, etc.)
4. Connect your requests to larger kingdom purposes
5. Conclude with praise to God for His ongoing work

## Conclusion: Learning from the Masters

The biblical prayer warriors we've examined—Moses, David, and Paul—each offer unique and complementary models for our own prayer lives. From Moses, we learn boldness in intercession and hunger for God's presence. From David, we discover emotional honesty and the journey from lament to trust. From Paul, we gain theological depth and kingdom perspective.

The Puritans understood that studying these prayer masters wasn't merely an academic exercise but a practical apprenticeship. As Richard Baxter wrote, "It is a mercy that we have the words of holy men who have gone before us to help our prayers. But we must not content ourselves with the fruits of their compositions without seeking the same Spirit of prayer by which they expressed themselves."

As you implement the practices suggested in this chapter, remember that your goal isn't to imitate biblical prayers mechanically but to internalize their patterns and principles. In time, the ways of Moses, David, and Paul will become your own—not through artificial imitation but through the work of the same Spirit who inspired their prayers in the first place.
