## Understanding Prayer as Both Art and Discipline

Have you ever felt that your prayers seem ineffective—bouncing off the ceiling rather than reaching God's ear? Or perhaps you wonder if there's more to prayer than what you've experienced? You're not alone. Christians throughout history have wrestled with these same questions.

The Puritans approached prayer as both an art to be cultivated and a discipline to be practiced. They understood that while prayer is fundamentally a relationship with God, certain principles can help us pray more effectively. This chapter explores those principles, drawing particularly on the insights of Richard Baxter and Thomas Watson.

## Richard Baxter's Guidance on Disciplined Prayer

Richard Baxter (1615-1691), known for his practical wisdom, wrote extensively on prayer in works like *The Saints' Everlasting Rest* and *A Christian Directory*. He believed that disciplined approach to prayer would lead to deeper spiritual communion.

### 1. The Virtue of Method in Prayer

Baxter advocated for methodical prayer—not as rigid formality but as thoughtful structure. He wrote:

> "Method is necessary for the right performance of all rational actions... He that useth no method, but lets his thoughts run up and down neglectively, will be as ineffectual in his prayer, as in his study, or conference, or any other service."

For Baxter, having a plan for prayer wasn't legalism but loving attention. Just as we might plan carefully for an important conversation with someone we love, we should approach our conversation with God thoughtfully.

**Practical Framework**: Baxter suggested organizing prayer around key elements, which we might remember using the acronym ACTS:
- Adoration: Beginning with praise for who God is
- Confession: Acknowledging sins and shortcomings
- Thanksgiving: Expressing gratitude for God's blessings
- Supplication: Making requests for ourselves and others

**Exercise**: For your next prayer time, use the ACTS framework as a starting point. Spend at least a few minutes on each element, noting how this structure changes your prayer experience.

### 2. Prayer and Scripture: Inseparable Companions

Baxter emphasized the connection between Scripture and prayer, viewing them as complementary spiritual disciplines:

> "Reading without prayer, and prayer without reading, are not profitable; and if you use both, you will be the better for both."

He taught that Scripture provides the language and content for our prayers, while prayer helps us internalize Scripture's truth.

**Practical Application**: Try Baxter's approach of "praying through Scripture":
1. Read a short Bible passage slowly (perhaps a psalm or portion of a Gospel)
2. Pause after each significant thought
3. Turn that thought into prayer—either praise, confession, or petition
4. Continue until you've prayed through the entire passage

**Group Discussion Question**: How might consistently connecting Scripture and prayer transform both your Bible reading and your prayer life?

### 3. The Right Use of Time in Prayer

Baxter was concerned about both the regularity and duration of prayer. He wrote:

> "Better be short and reverent, than long and neglectful. Though he is to be justly suspected that will never pray long, yet he is more to be suspected that is weary of praying long."

This balanced perspective reminds us that effective prayer isn't measured by minutes or hours but by engagement and reverence.

**Self-Examination**: Consider your current prayer patterns:
- Do you have consistent times for prayer?
- Are your prayers unhurried enough to allow for depth?
- If your prayer times are short, is it due to genuine constraints or lack of priority?
- If your prayers are long, are they filled with meaning or padded with repetition?

### 4. Creating a Sustainable Prayer Rhythm

Recognizing that life's demands vary, Baxter suggested flexible but consistent prayer patterns:

> "Though you should make your longer morning and evening prayer to be most as a constant course; yet at noon, or when you can find leisure, a shorter time well spent in secret, public, or family prayer may do much good, and keep the heart in tune for all the day."

This approach—combining set prayer times with spontaneous moments of connection—creates a sustainable prayer rhythm that can withstand life's varying demands.

**Practical Strategy**: Identify fixed times when you'll pray daily (perhaps morning and evening). Then select smaller "prayer triggers" throughout your day—red lights, coffee breaks, or phone notifications—that remind you to offer brief prayers.

## Thomas Watson on Developing Fervency and Persistence

Thomas Watson (c.1620-1686), known for his vivid writing style, focused on the qualities that make prayer powerful. In his works, particularly *The Lord's Prayer*, he emphasized fervency and persistence.

### 1. The Necessity of Fervency

Watson believed that cold, halfhearted prayers accomplish little. He colorfully stated:

> "A dull suitor never gets the woman... Fervent prayer, like a petard set against heaven's gate, makes it fly open."

This vivid imagery encapsulates Watson's conviction that God responds to prayers marked by spiritual passion and earnestness.

**Reflection Question**: Consider a recent heartfelt conversation with someone you love. What made it different from routine exchanges? How might those same qualities—attention, emotion, engagement—transform your prayers?

### 2. Distinguishing True Fervency from Mere Emotion

While emphasizing fervency, Watson carefully distinguished between genuine spiritual passion and manufactured emotionalism:

> "Fervency is not in the loudness of the voice... but in the earnestness of the heart. It is the crying of the heart that makes music in God's ears."

For Watson, true fervency flows from deep conviction rather than emotional performance.

**Prayer Exercise**: In your next prayer time, instead of trying to manufacture emotion, focus on honesty with God. Express what you truly believe, feel, and desire, without religious pretense. Notice how this authenticity affects your prayer experience.

### 3. Persistence in Prayer: Learning from the Importunate Widow

Watson drew extensively on Jesus' parable of the persistent widow (Luke 18:1-8) to teach the value of perseverance in prayer:

> "Though God does not answer at the first, yet he will hear at last; therefore persevere and hold out in prayer. Many give over if God does not come at the first hour; but he that would gain the blessing must wait."

This teaching challenges our modern expectation of immediate results and instant gratification. Watson saw persistence not as trying to wear God down but as demonstrating genuine faith and desire.

**Story Application**: Think of a significant prayer request in your life. How long have you persisted in asking? What might change if you approached it with the widow's determination—returning day after day with your request?

### 4. The Balance of Faith and Submission

Watson taught that effective prayer requires both bold faith and humble submission:

> "Prayer must be with faith... We should believe God will hear, and we shall receive; yet we must submit our will to God's. Prayer must be with submission to God's will."

This balanced approach prevents presumption on one hand and timidity on the other—allowing us to pray with both confidence and surrender.

**Group Exercise**: Consider a current prayer request. Together, formulate two versions:
1. A prayer of faith that expresses confidence in God's ability and willingness to answer
2. A prayer of submission that surrenders to God's wisdom if His answer differs from your desire

## Balancing Structure and Spontaneity in Prayer

While Puritans like Baxter valued method in prayer, they weren't rigid formalists. They recognized the need for both structure and freedom in our conversation with God.

### 1. The Value of Written Prayers

Contrary to common misconceptions, many Puritans valued written prayers alongside spontaneous ones. Arthur Hildersham (1563-1632) wrote:

> "We may lawfully use a set form of prayer... yet so that we rest not in the outward form of the words, but join our hearts in fervent affection."

This balanced view challenges both those who reject all written prayers as "unspiritual" and those who never move beyond formal prayers to personal expression.

**Practical Resource**: Consider using a resource like *The Valley of Vision* (a collection of Puritan prayers) alongside your own spontaneous prayers. Read a written prayer slowly, then use it as a springboard for your own expressions.

### 2. Creating Prayer Patterns That Work for You

Contemporary author Timothy Keller, drawing on Puritan insights, suggests that effective prayer often combines multiple elements:
- Prayer book or guide (structured prayer)
- Prayer list (specific petitions)
- Free prayer (spontaneous expression)
- Scripture meditation (Bible-guided prayer)

This integrated approach honors both structure and spontaneity.

**Personalized Application**: Which of these elements features most strongly in your current prayer life? Which is missing? Experiment with incorporating a neglected element into your prayer time this week.

## Developing a Sustainable Prayer Rhythm

The Puritans understood that consistency in prayer requires both discipline and sustainability. Their insights can help us establish prayer patterns that last.

### 1. Daily Rhythms of Prayer

Most Puritans practiced at minimum morning and evening prayer. John Owen wrote:

> "A day without prayer is a day without blessing, and a life without prayer is a life without purpose."

However, they adapted these practices to different life circumstances. Ministers might pray for hours; merchants and laborers might pray more briefly but with equal devotion.

**Practical Challenge**: Identify your most consistent daily rhythm (perhaps morning coffee, commute time, or evening routine). How could you integrate meaningful prayer into this established pattern?

### 2. The Role of Accountability in Consistency

Many Puritans participated in "societies"—small groups that met regularly for prayer, Scripture study, and mutual accountability. Contemporary research confirms what they intuited: we're more likely to maintain spiritual practices when we share them with others.

**Community Application**: Consider finding a prayer partner with whom you can check in weekly about your prayer lives. Share struggles, celebrations, and prayer requests. Even brief, regular accountability can dramatically boost consistency.

### 3. Prayer in Different Seasons of Life

The Puritans recognized that prayer practices must adapt to life's changing circumstances. Richard Sibbes offered this compassionate perspective:

> "God measures not prayer by length, but by the affection... He looks to our weakness. He knows our frame, and that we are but dust."

This grace-filled approach reminds us that prayer is a relationship to be nurtured, not a performance to be perfected.

**Reflection Exercise**: Identify your current life season (perhaps busy parenting, career transition, health challenge, or relative stability). How might your prayer practices wisely adapt to this season while maintaining consistency?

## Templates for Daily Prayer Inspired by Puritan Practices

As we conclude, here are several adaptable templates for incorporating Puritan prayer wisdom into daily life:

### 1. The Fifteen-Minute Morning Framework

For those with limited morning time:
- 2 minutes: Silence and centering (setting aside distractions)
- 3 minutes: Scripture reading (perhaps a psalm or Gospel portion)
- 5 minutes: Structured prayer using ACTS format
- 5 minutes: Specific petitions for the day ahead

### 2. The Commuter's Prayer Practice

For those who drive or take public transportation:
- Begin with a brief prayer of invitation and attention
- Use audio Scripture for listening prayer
- Pray through your day's appointments and interactions
- Conclude with surrender of the day to God's purposes

### 3. The Evening Examination

Based on Puritan practices of evening reflection:
- Express gratitude for specific gifts from the day
- Review the day's events, noticing God's presence
- Confess failures and shortcomings
- Receive assurance of forgiveness
- Entrust concerns and unfinished business to God

## Conclusion: Prayer as Both Gift and Practice

The Puritan principles explored in this chapter remind us that effective prayer combines grace and effort. Prayer is God's gift, requiring His spirit and help, yet also calls for our intentional cultivation.

Richard Baxter's methodical approach and Thomas Watson's emphasis on fervency may seem to emphasize different aspects of prayer, but they ultimately point to the same truth: prayer that honors God and transforms us involves both our hearts and our habits.

As you apply these principles, remember the ultimate Puritan insight: the goal of prayer is not primarily getting things from God but communion with Him. As Watson beautifully expressed it: "The end of prayer is that we may have communion with God."
