## The Central Challenge of Prayer

"Your will be done." These four simple words from the Lord's Prayer contain one of the greatest challenges of the Christian life. What does it mean to align our prayers with God's purposes? How do we balance bold asking with humble submission? When should we persist in specific requests, and when should we surrender our desires to God's wisdom?

These questions aren't merely theological abstractions—they touch the deepest struggles of our prayer lives. The mother praying for her wayward child, the patient facing a difficult diagnosis, the job-seeker facing rejection, all eventually face the same question: How do I pray when I don't know God's will in this situation?

The Puritans wrestled deeply with these questions. Living in times of plague, persecution, and political upheaval, they needed a robust understanding of prayer that could withstand life's harshest realities. This chapter explores their insights on aligning our prayers with God's purposes, drawing particularly on the wisdom of John Flavel and Jeremiah Burroughs.

## John Flavel on Aligning Prayers with God's Purposes

John Flavel (c.1630-1691) was a pastor who knew personal suffering intimately. He buried three wives and faced ejection from his pulpit for his religious convictions. His writings on prayer reflect both theological depth and hard-earned wisdom.

### 1. Understanding God's Will: Revealed and Secret

Flavel made a crucial distinction regarding God's will that helps us approach prayer with greater clarity:

> "God has revealed his will in his Word through commands, prohibitions, and principles. This is our rule for duty. But he has reserved many things to himself in his secret pleasure, which we ought not to be too curious to search into."

For Flavel, God's "revealed will" includes everything Scripture clearly teaches about God's character and purposes. His "secret will" encompasses God's specific plans for our lives and world history.

This distinction helps us understand what we can know with certainty (God's revealed character and commands) and what we must approach with humility (God's specific plans for our situations).

**Reflection Question**: When you pray, do you find yourself more focused on discovering God's secret plans or aligning with his revealed character? How might shifting your focus change your prayers?

### 2. The Purpose of Prayer: Alignment, Not Information

Flavel challenged the notion that prayer's primary purpose is to gain information about God's secret plans:

> "Prayer is not so much given to inform God or bend his will to ours, but to declare our desire of the glory of God, and to humble and conform our wills to his."

For Flavel, prayer is less about getting God to reveal His specific plans and more about aligning our hearts with His known character and purposes.

**Practical Application**: Before praying about a specific situation, take time to reflect on what you already know about God's character and promises from Scripture. How might these truths shape your requests?

### 3. Four Principles for Praying According to God's Will

Flavel offered practical guidance for aligning our prayers with God's purposes:

#### Pray with Scripture as Your Guide

> "Let the matter of your prayer be always agreeable to the written Word. To pray for what God has not promised is to pray without a ground."

Flavel believed that Scripture provides both the content and boundaries for our prayers. When our requests align with biblical promises and principles, we can pray with greater confidence.

**Bible Study Exercise**: Choose a pressing prayer concern. Search Scripture for promises or principles related to this situation. How might these biblical truths shape your specific request?

#### Balance Boldness and Submission

> "Join earnestness with submission. Desire nothing more earnestly than that the good pleasure of God may be done, even if His good pleasure should cross your strongest inclinations."

Flavel advocated neither passive resignation nor presumptuous demanding, but a middle way that brings our genuine desires to God while surrendering to His wisdom.

**Prayer Practice**: For an important request, try praying it two ways:
1. With bold specificity: "Lord, here is exactly what I'm asking..."
2. With humble submission: "Yet not my will, but yours be done."

#### Focus on Spiritual Goods

> "Let spiritual goods be desired for themselves and more earnestly than temporals; and temporal goods only as helps to spiritual and eternal goods."

Flavel encouraged prioritizing requests for spiritual growth, holiness, and kingdom advancement above material concerns—not because God doesn't care about our physical needs, but because spiritual blessings have eternal significance.

**Self-Examination**: Review your recent prayer requests. What proportion focused on spiritual growth versus material needs? How might you better balance these areas?

#### Remain Open to God's Unexpected Answers

> "God may deny a particular good you ask for, yet still hear and answer your prayer by giving something more necessary, though unasked for."

Flavel recognized that God sometimes answers our prayers in ways we didn't anticipate—not by giving exactly what we requested, but by providing what we truly need.

**Journaling Exercise**: Look back on prayers God seemed to "deny." Can you identify instances where He provided something different but ultimately better than what you requested?

## Jeremiah Burroughs on God's Sovereignty in Prayer

Jeremiah Burroughs (c.1600-1646) was known for his profound teaching on contentment amid difficult circumstances. His insights on prayer emphasize God's sovereignty and our appropriate response.

### 1. The Mystery of Providence in Prayer

Burroughs acknowledged the mystery of how our prayers interact with God's sovereign plans:

> "Though God has decreed all things that shall be, yet prayer is no vain thing; God has decreed the end and the means together. God having decreed the end, has also established prayer as one of the chief means to that end."

This balanced perspective helps us avoid two extremes: seeing prayer as unnecessary (since "God will do what He wants anyway") or viewing prayer as a way to control God (as if our requests dictate His actions).

**Group Discussion Question**: How does understanding that prayer is both meaningful and non-manipulative change your approach to difficult requests?

### 2. The Tension Between Bold Requests and Humble Submission

Burroughs addressed the apparent contradiction between Jesus' encouragement to ask boldly and His own prayer of submission in Gethsemane:

> "Christ would teach us to pray with earnestness and importunity, knocking and continuing in prayer; yet he would have us withal to submit our wills to God's... These two may well stand together: vehement supplication yet meek submission."

For Burroughs, there is no contradiction between passionate asking and humble submission—they are complementary aspects of healthy prayer.

**Practical Balance**: Consider a current significant prayer request. On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate:
- Your boldness in asking specifically (1=vague, 10=very specific)
- Your surrender to God's wisdom (1=demanding your way, 10=fully surrendered)
Healthy prayer seeks strength in both dimensions.

### 3. Seven Signs of True Submission in Prayer

Burroughs offered practical guidance for discerning whether our prayers reflect genuine submission:

#### Willingness to Wait on God's Timing

> "A submissive heart is willing to wait upon God and for God. It does not make haste and say, 'If the Lord does not answer me quickly, I will cease to pray.'"

True submission accepts that God's timing often differs from ours, and continues in prayer without imposing deadlines on God.

**Self-Examination**: When was the last time you continued praying for something long after you expected an answer? What helped you persist?

#### Freedom from Bitterness When Requests Are Denied

> "When the heart is rightly subdued to God, no murmuring thoughts rise within against God for refusal, but they fall down quietly before Him."

Burroughs suggested that our response to apparently unanswered prayer reveals much about the state of our submission.

**Heart Check**: Think of a significant prayer request that God has not granted. What emotions arise when you consider this situation? Bring these honestly before God, asking for grace to trust His wisdom.

#### Continued Trust in God's Goodness

> "A submissive spirit continues to acknowledge God as good and wise, even when His providence seems to contradict our understanding of what love should do."

For Burroughs, true submission maintains confidence in God's character even when His actions are puzzling.

**Worship Practice**: In the midst of a difficult prayer situation, intentionally praise God for specific aspects of His character (wisdom, love, faithfulness). Notice how this practice affects your perspective.

#### Willingness to Accept God's Answer in Any Form

> "A heart rightly subdued to God is as willing to receive mercy in God's way as it is desirous to receive mercy itself."

Burroughs observed that we often want not just God's blessing but God's blessing in our prescribed manner.

**Reflection Question**: Is there a situation where you've been insisting not just on what God should do, but exactly how He should do it? How might opening to His methods change your prayer?

#### Freedom from Questioning God's Decisions

> "A submissive heart does not call God to account for His dealings, saying, 'Why do you thus to one and thus to another?' but acquiesces in God's wisdom."

Burroughs acknowledged the reality of our questions but emphasized that mature submission eventually rests in God's wisdom rather than demanding explanations.

**Prayer Exercise**: If you're struggling with "why" questions about God's decisions, try expressing them honestly in prayer, then consciously pivot to statements of trust: "I don't understand why, but I choose to trust Your wisdom."

#### Willingness to Glorify God Even Through Suffering

> "Such a heart desires that God may be glorified in any condition, though it should be its own greatest affliction and sorrow."

Perhaps Burroughs' most challenging mark of submission is the willingness to accept personal suffering if it advances God's glory and purposes.

**Meditation Focus**: Consider Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane, where He accepted suffering for God's greater purposes. How does His example inspire and challenge your own prayers?

## The Tension Between Bold Requests and Humble Submission

Both Flavel and Burroughs recognized the apparent paradox in Scripture's teaching on prayer: we are commanded to ask boldly (Matthew 7:7-11, James 4:2) yet also to submit humbly to God's will (Matthew 6:10, James 4:15). How do we hold these together?

### 1. Understanding the Compatibility of Boldness and Submission

Rather than seeing these as contradictory approaches, the Puritans understood them as complementary aspects of mature prayer:

- **Boldness** flows from confidence in God's character, promises, and invitation to approach Him as Father.
- **Submission** arises from recognition of God's superior wisdom and loving purposes.

Mature prayer embraces both, much as a child might earnestly ask a loving parent for something while trusting that parent's judgment if the answer is "no" or "not yet."

**Case Study**: Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane (Matthew 26:36-46) perfectly demonstrates this balance. He asked specifically and intensely ("let this cup pass from me") while fully surrendering to the Father's will ("yet not as I will, but as you will").

### 2. Recognizing Different Types of Prayer Requests

The Puritans recognized that different types of requests call for different applications of boldness and submission:

#### Prayers for Clear Biblical Promises

When praying for what God has explicitly promised (forgiveness, spiritual growth, salvation of others), we can pray with great confidence that our request aligns with God's will.

**Example**: "Lord, I ask for wisdom to navigate this decision, confident that you have promised to give wisdom generously to all who ask." (James 1:5)

#### Prayers for Personal Preferences

When praying about matters where Scripture gives freedom (career choices, major life decisions), we should express our desires honestly while recognizing that God may have other plans.

**Example**: "Lord, I deeply desire this job opportunity and ask you to open this door if it aligns with your purposes. Yet I trust your wisdom if you have something different for me."

#### Prayers Amid Mystery and Suffering

When praying through situations where God's purposes are especially mysterious (chronic illness, unexpected loss), we may experience the greatest tension between asking and surrendering.

**Example**: "Father, I ask for healing if it brings you glory. I honestly confess my struggle to understand your purposes in this suffering, yet I choose to trust your loving wisdom."

## How to Pray When God's Will Seems Unclear

Many of our most difficult prayer situations involve uncertainty about God's specific will. Both Flavel and Burroughs offer guidance for these challenging circumstances.

### 1. Begin with What Is Clear

Flavel advised starting prayer by focusing on what we know with certainty about God's character and revealed will:

> "Though you cannot see your particular case in Scripture, yet you may see the attributes of God which give relief and foundation for faith in such a particular case."

**Practical Application**: When facing uncertainty, start your prayer by affirming what you know for certain: God's love, wisdom, power, and faithfulness. Let these foundational truths shape your specific requests.

### 2. Submit Your Understanding to Scripture

Burroughs emphasized testing our impressions and desires against Scripture:

> "Many are deceived by taking the strong stirrings of their own hearts to be the voice of God's Spirit."

This wisdom helps us avoid the trap of mistaking our strong desires for God's specific direction.

**Scripture Exercise**: For an important prayer concern, identify 3-5 Scripture passages that provide principles relevant to your situation. Let these shape how you pray about the specifics.

### 3. Consult Godly Community

Both Flavel and Burroughs valued the discernment of the Christian community in understanding God's will:

> "The mutual light Christians receive from one another by way of spiritual conference is often necessary for knowing the will of God in special difficult cases." - Flavel

**Community Practice**: Before making a major decision, ask 2-3 mature believers to pray with you about the situation. Their insights may help you better discern how to align your prayers with God's purposes.

### 4. Pay Attention to Providential Circumstances

Flavel believed that God often guides through circumstances, though these should always be interpreted in light of Scripture:

> "God's works and words do illustrate each other. What you read in His Word, you may see actings in His providence."

**Discernment Practice**: Consider your current circumstances. What doors seem to be opening or closing? How might these providential factors inform your prayers?

### 5. Exercise "Sanctified Common Sense"

The Puritans valued sanctified reasoning—using our God-given mental faculties while acknowledging their limitations:

> "God has given us understanding and reason to judge and consider of things, but He would have us to set the judgment and consideration of things a-work. Though God has decreed all actions and events, it does not follow that our choice is needless." - Burroughs

**Decision Framework**: When facing an uncertain situation, consider:
- Biblical principles relevant to the decision
- Wise counsel from godly advisors
- Circumstances that may indicate direction
- Your own abilities, limitations, and desires

## Practice in Praying with Both Confidence and Surrender

As we conclude this chapter, here are several exercises to help you develop prayers that balance bold asking with humble submission:

### 1. The Two-Part Prayer

For major requests, try structuring your prayer in two parts:
- First, express your specific desire with clarity and passion
- Then, explicitly surrender the outcome to God's wisdom

Example: "Father, I earnestly ask for healing from this condition, believing you have the power to restore health completely. Yet I surrender this request to your perfect wisdom, trusting that your plan for me is good even if it differs from my desire."

### 2. The Three-Circle Exercise

Draw three concentric circles on paper:
- Inner circle: "God's revealed will" (write biblical commands and promises)
- Middle circle: "My requests" (write your specific prayer requests)
- Outer circle: "God's secret will" (leave blank to represent trust in God's unfolding plan)

As you pray, consciously move from the inner circle outward—starting with what you know of God's revealed will, expressing your specific requests, and surrendering to God's secret will.

### 3. Praying Scripture with Personal Application

Select a biblical prayer (such as Paul's prayers in Ephesians 1:15-23 or 3:14-21) and personalize it for your situation, adding specific details while maintaining the prayer's God-centered focus.

Example: "Father, I pray that you would give me a spirit of wisdom and revelation as I face this job interview tomorrow. Help me know you better through this process. Enlighten the eyes of my heart so I can see the hope to which you've called me, even if this particular opportunity doesn't work out..."

### 4. The Daily Surrender

Incorporate a brief prayer of submission into your daily routine:

"Father, today I surrender my agenda, expectations, and desires to you. Help me want what you want, love what you love, and choose what you choose. I trust your wisdom for the seen and unseen circumstances of this day."

This simple practice cultivates the habit of submission that can carry you through more difficult prayer situations.

## Conclusion: From Tension to Trust

The tension between bold asking and humble submission isn't a problem to solve but a mystery to embrace. The Puritans remind us that this apparent paradox reflects the very nature of our relationship with God—we are both beloved children invited to ask and finite creatures called to trust.

As Jeremiah Burroughs beautifully expressed it: "The soul truly suited to God's will can say, 'This rule that God has established is exactly right. It would not be right if my will should determine the way things should be; but it is right that God's will should determine it.'"

In the end, prayer's highest purpose isn't getting what we want but becoming who God wants us to be—people who desire His will more than our own. This transformation doesn't happen instantly but gradually as we practice bringing our honest requests to God while surrendering to His wisdom.

The Puritans would assure us that no prayer offered in this spirit is ever wasted. Even when God's answer differs from our desire, the very act of praying with both boldness and submission shapes us more into the image of Christ, who in Gethsemane prayed the perfect prayer: "Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done."
