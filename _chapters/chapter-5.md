## The Doctor's Dilemma

Dr. Sarah Chen stared at the job offers on her desk. The first was from a prestigious hospital in Boston—excellent salary, cutting-edge research opportunities, and professional prestige. The second was from a small clinic serving an underserved rural community—modest pay, limited resources, but tremendous need.

For weeks, she had prayed for guidance, but clarity remained elusive. "Lord," she whispered, "I just want to do your will. But how do I know what that is?"

This tension—between desiring God's will and discerning it—is one every praying Christian faces. Whether we're making major life decisions or simply wondering how to pray about ongoing situations, we often find ourselves asking: What is God's will in this matter? How should I align my prayers with His purposes? And what does it mean to submit to His will when it differs from my desires?

The Puritans, with their unwavering commitment to Scripture and profound understanding of human nature, provide rich guidance for navigating these questions. Two Puritan writers offer particularly valuable insights: John Flavel on aligning our prayers with God's purposes, and Jeremiah Burroughs on finding contentment in God's sovereign decisions.

## John Flavel: Aligning Prayers with God's Purposes

John Flavel (1628-1691) served as a minister in Dartmouth, England, enduring persecution for his nonconformist convictions. His writings reveal a pastor deeply concerned with helping ordinary believers understand how their prayers could align with God's purposes.

### Understanding God's Will

Flavel distinguished between what theologians call God's "decretive will" (what He has sovereignly determined) and His "preceptive will" (what He has commanded in Scripture):

> "There is a great difference between God's secret counsels by which He governs all events, and His commands by which He governs our duties. The former is the rule of His actions; the latter, of ours."

For Flavel, this distinction was crucial for prayer because:
- We cannot know God's secret plans in advance
- We can know God's revealed commands with certainty
- Our prayers should align with what God has clearly revealed
- We must submit to God's sovereign decisions as they unfold

**Reflection Question**: How might confusing these two aspects of God's will create struggles in your prayer life? When have you felt frustrated trying to discern God's secret plans rather than focusing on His revealed commands?

### Flavel's Guidance for Discerning God's Will in Prayer

In his practical work *The Mystery of Providence*, Flavel offered several principles for discerning how to pray according to God's will:

#### 1. Begin with What Is Clearly Revealed

> "In all cases where God's mind is revealed in His Word, we may pray with confidence... Where God's will is revealed, conform your will to it; where it is not revealed, submit your will to His disposal."

Flavel taught that:
- Scripture provides clear guidance for many prayer concerns
- God's moral will is always clearly expressed in His commands
- We can pray with certainty for spiritual growth and holiness

**Practical Application**: Before praying about any situation, ask: "What aspects of God's will are already clearly revealed in Scripture regarding this matter?" Begin by praying in alignment with these revealed aspects.

#### 2. Observe Providential Indicators

Flavel believed that while providence alone cannot determine God's will, it often provides helpful indicators:

> "Though we cannot know the mind of God out of His Word, yet we may know His hand in providences. The work of God has a voice, if we had skill enough to understand it."

He suggested looking for:
- Open and closed doors of opportunity
- Convergence of multiple indicators
- Inner peace about a particular direction

Flavel cautioned, however, that providence must always be interpreted through Scripture, never independently of it.

**Group Discussion Question**: Share an experience when God's providence seemed to guide your prayers in a particular direction. How did you discern this was truly God's guidance rather than merely your preference?

#### 3. Seek Sanctified Judgment

> "Judgments of Christians, when sanctified, are the feet of the soul by which it walks to the throne of grace."

Flavel emphasized that:
- God gives wisdom to those who ask (James 1:5)
- Sanctified reason is a gift to be used in discernment
- Seeking counsel from mature believers aids discernment

**Practical Step**: Identify 2-3 spiritually mature individuals who might help you discern how to pray about a specific situation. Consider meeting with them specifically to seek wisdom about aligning your prayers with God's purposes.

### Flavel on Praying for Uncertain Outcomes

Flavel offered wise counsel for situations where God's specific will remains unclear:

#### The Principle of Conditional Submission

> "It is our duty to desire the accomplishment of God's will, rather than our own. Even Christ, whose will was never inordinate, said to His Father, 'Not my will, but thine be done.'"

Flavel recommended:
- Expressing desires honestly to God
- Adding "if it be Your will" with genuine submission
- Maintaining faith that God knows what is best

**Practical Prayer Framework**: For uncertain matters, Flavel suggested this approach:
1. Express your desire clearly to God
2. Acknowledge the limits of your understanding
3. Submit explicitly to God's wisdom
4. Commit to accepting God's answer, whatever it may be

**Journaling Prompt**: Consider a situation where you're unsure how to pray. Write a prayer using Flavel's framework, honestly expressing your desires while submitting to God's wisdom.

## Jeremiah Burroughs: Finding Contentment in God's Sovereign Will

Jeremiah Burroughs (1599-1646) wrote his classic work *The Rare Jewel of Christian Contentment* during a time of great personal and national turmoil. His insights on submission to God's will offer profound guidance for prayer.

### Understanding True Submission

Burroughs defined contentment as "that sweet, inward, quiet, gracious frame of spirit, which freely submits to and delights in God's wise and fatherly disposal in every condition." He distinguished between:

- **Stoic resignation** – a passive, fatalistic acceptance
- **Christian submission** – an active, faith-filled embrace

For Burroughs, true submission in prayer involves not merely accepting God's will but actively embracing it as good, wise, and loving.

> "A Christian comes to this contentment not by having his own desires satisfied, but by having his will changed and made the same as God's."

**Self-Examination**: In your prayers, do you tend toward stoic resignation ("whatever will be, will be") or genuine Christian submission ("Your will is better than mine")? What's the practical difference between these approaches?

### Burroughs' Principles for Submitting to God's Will

Burroughs offered several principles that help us genuinely submit to God's will in prayer:

#### 1. Recognize God's Right to Rule

> "The Lord knows better how to manage things than you... When the ruler of a kingdom knows what is best for the whole state, shall a poor countryman come and tell him what laws to govern by?"

Burroughs taught that:
- God's sovereignty is absolute
- His wisdom is perfect
- His love is unfailing

When we truly grasp these truths, submission becomes not a burden but a privilege—we entrust our concerns to One infinitely wiser and more loving than ourselves.

**Prayer Exercise**: Spend 5 minutes meditating on God's wisdom, sovereignty, and love. Then offer a prayer surrendering a specific concern to His perfect governance, acknowledging His right to determine the outcome.

#### 2. Embrace the Beauty of God's Will

Burroughs believed submission goes beyond mere acceptance to active delight:

> "It is one thing to submit to God's will because you cannot help it, and another thing to be pleased with His will... A gracious heart says, 'If this is the Lord's will, I am not only satisfied but pleased.'"

He encouraged believers to:
- Look for God's purposes in every circumstance
- Trust His perfect timing
- Recognize that His "no" is as much a manifestation of His love as His "yes"

**Reflection Question**: When has God's denial of a request eventually proved to be a blessing? How might remembering these instances help you pray with greater trust about current concerns?

#### 3. Surrender Your Timing to God

Burroughs observed that we often struggle not with God's will itself but with His timing:

> "A child of God must be willing to wait for God's time for the enjoyment of any good that he desires... It may be that this is God's time to humble you and prepare you for the mercy that He has stored up."

He counseled:
- Seeing delays as preparation, not denial
- Trusting God's perfect timing
- Using waiting periods for spiritual growth

**Practical Application**: For a prayer request that seems delayed, reframe your prayer to embrace God's timing. Instead of asking simply for the desired outcome, ask for grace to wait well and for growth through the waiting.

#### 4. Align Your Will with God's

Burroughs' most profound insight was that true contentment comes not from getting what we want but from wanting what God wants:

> "The excellency of a Christian is when he can bring his will to God's; not when he can bring God's will to his."

He taught that this alignment happens as we:
- Study Scripture to understand God's values and priorities
- Contemplate Christ's perfect submission
- Allow suffering to reshape our desires

**Prayer Practice**: Before presenting requests to God, spend time praying, "Lord, shape my desires to match Yours." Then examine each request in light of God's revealed priorities in Scripture.

### Burroughs on the Tension Between Bold Requests and Humble Submission

Like many Puritans, Burroughs recognized the biblical tension between praying boldly and submitting humbly. He offered wisdom for holding these in balance:

> "We may with greatest liberty make known our requests to God, and shoot our arrows of prayer to Him with delight, as long as we keep this frame of spirit, to submit to His denials."

Burroughs suggested:
- Praying with holy boldness, yet without presumption
- Expressing desires fully, while holding them with open hands
- Accepting God's answers graciously, whether yes or no

**Group Discussion Prompt**: How do we maintain both bold faith and humble submission in prayer? Discuss practical ways to hold these seemingly opposite approaches in biblical tension.

## Practical Guidance for Praying When God's Will Seems Unclear

Drawing from both Flavel and Burroughs, here are practical approaches for those times when God's specific will seems uncertain:

### 1. The Scripture-First Approach

**Method**:
1. Identify the specific issue requiring prayer
2. Search Scripture for relevant principles and commands
3. Align your prayer with what Scripture clearly reveals
4. For aspects not addressed in Scripture, pray with conditional submission
5. Trust God with the outcome

**Biblical Example**: Paul's thorn in the flesh (2 Corinthians 12:7-10). Paul prayed specifically for removal but submitted to God's higher purpose.

### 2. The Multi-Faceted Discernment Approach

**Method**:
1. Begin with prayer for wisdom (James 1:5)
2. Study relevant Scriptural principles
3. Seek counsel from mature believers
4. Consider providential circumstances
5. Pay attention to the inner witness of the Spirit
6. Look for convergence among these various indicators

**Puritan Insight**: Flavel noted, "The more ways God speaks to one thing, the more certainly we may conclude it to be His will."

### 3. The Two-List Method

**Method**:
1. Create two columns on paper
2. In the first, list what you know with certainty about God's will from Scripture
3. In the second, list what remains uncertain
4. Pray with confidence about everything in the first column
5. Pray with conditional submission about everything in the second

**Practical Example**: In praying about a job change, your first column might include integrity in the workplace, providing for your family, using your gifts, etc. Your second column might include specific location, timing, or which particular job offer to accept.

### 4. The Desire-Surrender Cycle

**Method**:
1. Express your desires honestly to God
2. Surrender those desires completely
3. Ask God to either fulfill your desire or change it
4. Rest in His wisdom, regardless of outcome

**Puritan Wisdom**: Burroughs taught, "I am going to heaven; what does it matter if my way there is difficult? If God gives me a hard time, what is that to having my sins forgiven and going to heaven eternally?"

## Exercises for Practicing Submission in Prayer

Here are structured exercises to help develop a habit of discerning and submitting to God's will:

### Exercise 1: The Surrender Inventory

**Purpose**: To practice surrendering specific areas to God's will

**Method**:
1. List 5-7 areas of your life (relationships, career, health, etc.)
2. For each area, write one sentence expressing your current desire
3. For each desire, write a corresponding statement of surrender
4. Pray through both your desires and your statements of surrender
5. Notice which surrenders feel most difficult and bring these specifically before God

**Example**:
- Desire: "I want my health to improve so I can be more active."
- Surrender: "I trust that in whatever state of health I find myself, You will accomplish Your purposes in and through me."

**Time Required**: 15-20 minutes

### Exercise 2: Praying the Lord's Prayer with Emphasis on Submission

**Purpose**: To use Jesus' model prayer to cultivate submission

**Method**:
1. Slowly pray through each phrase of the Lord's Prayer
2. Pause extensively at "Thy will be done"
3. Consider specific applications of this phrase to your current circumstances
4. Name areas where you struggle to embrace God's will
5. Conclude by reaffirming "For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever"

**Puritan Connection**: Several Puritan writers, including Thomas Watson, wrote extensive meditations on each phrase of the Lord's Prayer.

**Time Required**: 10 minutes

### Exercise 3: The Contentment Challenge

**Purpose**: To develop Burroughs' "rare jewel of Christian contentment" in prayer

**Method**:
1. Identify a situation where God's answer differs from your desire
2. Write three potential good purposes God might have in this circumstance
3. List three potential spiritual benefits this situation might yield
4. Craft a prayer that embraces God's purposes while honestly acknowledging your feelings
5. End with a statement of trust in God's wisdom

**Puritan Insight**: Burroughs wrote, "In one providence I can see more of God than in all the histories of the world."

**Time Required**: 15 minutes

## Reflection Questions

1. Which do you find more challenging: discerning God's will or submitting to it once you believe you understand it?

2. How has your understanding of "praying according to God's will" been clarified or changed by the insights in this chapter?

3. What specific area of your life do you currently struggle to surrender to God's sovereign purposes? What makes this surrender particularly difficult?

4. In what ways might adding "if it be Your will" to your prayers become an empty phrase rather than a genuine expression of submission? How can you ensure it remains meaningful?

5. How has God used His "no" answers to prayer to shape your spiritual growth? What might this reveal about His purposes in current situations where His answer seems to be "wait" or "no"?

## A Prayer of Submission

> Sovereign Lord,
> 
> You who hold all things in Your wise and loving hands,
> I come acknowledging my limited understanding
> and my tendency to cling to my own desires.
> 
> Teach me what Jeremiah Burroughs called
> that rare jewel of Christian contentment—
> not mere resignation to Your will,
> but delight in it, trust in it, rest in it.
> 
> Like John Flavel, help me distinguish
> between what You have clearly revealed
> and what remains mysterious to me.
> Give me confidence to pray according to Your Word
> and humility to submit to Your providence.
> 
> I bring before You my honest desires,
> not hiding them, but holding them with open hands.
> Fulfill them if they align with Your purposes;
> transform them if they do not.
> 
> May my prayer increasingly become
> not "my will be done" but "Thy will be done,"
> not reluctantly, but with the confidence
> that Your will is always better than mine.
> 
> Through Christ, who in Gethsemane
> showed us perfect submission, Amen.
