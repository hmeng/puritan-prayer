## The Word and Prayer: Inseparable Companions

What words should we use when speaking to the Creator of the universe? How can we be confident that our prayers align with God's character and purposes? Where do we find language powerful enough to express the deepest longings of our hearts?

For the Puritans, the answer was clear: Scripture itself provides the vocabulary, patterns, and content for our prayers. They believed that the Bible and prayer are inseparable companions—God speaks to us through His Word, and we respond to Him in prayer, often using the very words He has given us.

Thomas Boston (1676-1732) described this relationship beautifully: "The Word and prayer are like the two arms of Moses lifted up for the defeat of Amalek. Where one is held up, the other is sure to fall down." For Boston and his fellow Puritans, Scripture-saturated prayer wasn't simply one approach among many—it was essential to a healthy prayer life.

This chapter explores the Puritan practice of biblically grounded prayer, drawing primarily on the insights of Thomas Boston and Matthew Henry, whose commentary on the Bible deeply influenced generations of believers in their prayer lives.

## Thomas Boston on Praying Scripture

Thomas Boston, a Scottish Puritan minister known for his pastoral sensitivity, wrote extensively about integrating Scripture into prayer. His approach offers practical guidance for anchoring our prayers in God's Word.

### 1. Why Pray Scripture: Boston's Rationale

Boston offered several compelling reasons for building our prayers on biblical foundations:

#### Scripture Provides God-Honoring Language

> "In the Scriptures we have the mind of God; so that praying according to them, we pray according to the will of God... We need not fear to ask anything that is there promised."

Boston believed that Scripture provides us with words and requests that we know honor God, addressing the common concern: "Am I praying for the right things in the right way?"

**Reflection Question**: How confident do you feel about the content of your prayers? How might greater use of Scripture address any uncertainty?

#### Biblical Prayer Corrects Our Natural Tendencies

> "Left to ourselves, we would ask for what would harm us, or we would fail to ask for what we truly need. The Word corrects our natural desires and teaches us to pray wisely."

Boston recognized that our prayer instincts, shaped by our fallen nature and cultural influences, often need reformation through Scripture.

**Self-Examination**: Consider your recent prayer requests. How many reflect biblical priorities versus cultural values or personal comfort? How might Scripture reshape your prayer concerns?

#### God's Promises Fuel Faith in Prayer

> "Faith feeds upon the promises in prayer, taking them before the Lord, saying with David, 'Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.'"

Boston taught that God's promises in Scripture provide both the content for our requests and the confidence to believe that God will hear and answer.

**Practical Application**: Identify a current challenge you're facing. Search for biblical promises related to that situation. How does praying these promises affect your faith and confidence?

### 2. Boston's Method of Praying Scripture

Beyond explaining why we should pray biblically, Boston offered practical guidance on how to do so:

#### Begin with Scripture Reading

> "Let the Christian, before he engages in prayer, read or call to mind some portion of the Lord's Word... This prepares the heart for prayer, furnishing matter and desires."

Boston advised intentional Bible reading as preparation for prayer, allowing God's Word to shape our thoughts and desires before we begin speaking to Him.

**Prayer Preparation**: Before your next prayer time, spend 5-10 minutes reading a psalm, Gospel passage, or epistle. Notice how this reading influences what you pray about and how you express yourself.

#### Turn Biblical Truths into Personal Petitions

> "The precious truths of the Word are to be turned into petitions, and the holy commands thereof into prayers for grace to fulfill them."

Boston suggested a simple but profound practice: transform biblical statements into personal prayers. Doctrinal truths become praise; commands become requests for grace to obey; promises become petitions for fulfillment.

**Scripture Transformation Exercise**: Practice turning different types of Scripture into prayer:
- A doctrinal statement (e.g., Ephesians 1:3-6) into praise
- A command (e.g., Colossians 3:12-14) into a request for grace to obey
- A promise (e.g., Philippians 4:19) into a petition for fulfillment

#### Use Biblical Patterns as Templates

> "The Lord's Prayer is given not only as a prayer itself but as a pattern of prayer... showing the parts of which our prayers should consist."

Boston viewed scriptural prayers—especially the Lord's Prayer—as templates to structure our own prayers, ensuring balance and comprehensiveness.

**Pattern Application**: Use the Lord's Prayer as a template for your next prayer time, expanding each petition with your specific concerns:
- "Our Father in heaven..." (begin with relationship and reverence)
- "Your kingdom come..." (pray for God's purposes in various situations)
- "Give us today our daily bread..." (present specific material needs)
- And so on through each petition

### 3. Praying Specific Scripture Genres

Boston recognized that different types of biblical texts can be prayed in different ways:

#### Praying the Psalms

> "The Psalms are a treasure of prayer and praise, providing words for every heart condition... When you know not what to say, the psalmist will teach you."

Boston considered the Psalms particularly valuable for prayer because they express the full range of human emotions and experiences before God.

**Psalm Selection Guide**: Boston suggested connecting psalms to your emotional state:
- In joy: Pray Psalms of praise (e.g., Psalms 100, 103, 145)
- In sorrow: Pray Psalms of lament (e.g., Psalms 42, 88, 130)
- In confusion: Pray Psalms seeking guidance (e.g., Psalms 25, 43, 119)
- In gratitude: Pray Psalms of thanksgiving (e.g., Psalms 30, 107, 118)

#### Praying the Promises

> "The promises of the Word are the church's treasury... To take a promise and put it into a prayer is to put the key in the lock to open the treasury."

Boston placed special emphasis on praying God's promises, believing this practice unlocks the treasures of God's provision.

**Promise Prayer Method**: For each promise you find relevant to your situation:
1. Acknowledge that God made this promise
2. Express confidence in God's faithfulness
3. Apply the promise to your specific circumstance
4. Ask for its fulfillment in God's timing and way

## Matthew Henry on Incorporating Biblical Language in Prayer

Matthew Henry (1662-1714), best known for his comprehensive Bible commentary, also wrote extensively about prayer. His *Method for Prayer* (1710) demonstrates his commitment to using biblical language in prayer.

### 1. Scripture as the Language of Prayer

Henry believed that biblical language offers unique advantages in prayer:

#### Scripture Provides Holy and Reverent Speech

> "The expressions of Scripture are sound expressions, and we must praise God in the words which the Holy Ghost teaches."

Henry observed that Scripture provides language worthy of addressing God—avoiding both casual familiarity and artificial formality.

**Language Inventory**: Review your typical prayer vocabulary. Do you tend toward overly casual expressions or formal religious jargon? How might biblical language offer a more balanced alternative?

#### Biblical Language Connects Us to the Communion of Saints

> "When we make use of Scripture expressions in prayer, with understanding and without affectation, we speak the language of Canaan indeed—the language of the citizens of Zion."

Henry saw using biblical language as participation in the historic communion of saints—connecting our prayers to believers across time who have prayed using the same words.

**Historical Reflection**: Consider how the biblical phrases you pray have been used by Christians throughout history—from the early church to medieval monastics to Reformation believers to the present day. How does this connection enrich your prayer experience?

#### Scripture Provides Language for Difficult Experiences

> "When our case is such that we know not what to pray for as we ought, nor what to ask for the good of our condition, blessed be God, the Holy Spirit helps our infirmities by furnishing us with Scripture expressions suited to our case."

Henry recognized that Scripture offers language for experiences when our own words fail us—particularly in times of suffering, confusion, or spiritual dryness.

**Difficult Circumstance Application**: If you're currently facing a difficult situation where words feel inadequate, identify a biblical passage expressing similar emotions (many psalms of lament or portions of Job may apply). Try praying using these words.

### 2. Henry's Method of Incorporating Biblical Language

Henry didn't merely advocate for using Scripture in prayer; he offered a systematic approach to doing so:

#### Weaving Scripture Phrases into Prayer

> "When we would express the desires and wishes of our souls before God, we do well to borrow our expressions from the Bible. This gives our prayers substance and strength."

Rather than simply quoting entire biblical passages, Henry often wove individual phrases and verses seamlessly into his prayers, creating a tapestry of Scripture-infused expression.

**Phrase Collection Exercise**: Create a collection of biblical phrases related to a specific theme (God's faithfulness, guidance, comfort in affliction, etc.). Practice incorporating these phrases naturally into your prayers.

#### Arranging Scripture by Subject for Prayer

Henry's *Method for Prayer* organized Scripture passages by prayer topics, creating ready references for different prayer needs. Categories included:
- Adoration and praise
- Confession of sin
- Petitions for grace
- Thanksgiving
- Intercession for others

**Subject Organization**: Create your own mini "method for prayer" by collecting verses for 3-5 prayer categories most relevant to your current life circumstances. Keep these accessible for regular prayer reference.

#### Adapting Biblical Language to Personal Circumstances

> "We may in prayer allude to a Scripture phrase, and make use of it, though we do not quote it exactly, for in prayer we take a greater liberty of expression than in preaching or other public speaking."

Henry advocated freedom in adapting biblical language to personal circumstances—not treating Scripture as a rigid formula but as a flexible vocabulary for conversation with God.

**Adaptation Practice**: Select a biblical prayer (such as Paul's prayer in Ephesians 3:14-21) and adapt it to your specific situation, personalizing phrases to address your particular concerns while maintaining the biblical pattern.

### 3. Building a Biblical Prayer Vocabulary

Henry recognized that incorporating Scripture into prayer requires familiarity with the Bible—a challenge for many believers. He offered practical guidance for developing biblical prayer vocabulary:

#### Regular Bible Reading with Prayer in Mind

> "Read the Scriptures, not as a historian, to know what men did; nor as a linguist, to know what men said; but as a Christian, to find matter for prayer and praise."

Henry encouraged reading Scripture specifically to gather prayer material—not simply for information or study but for conversation with God.

**Directed Reading**: During your next Bible reading time, keep a notepad nearby specifically for recording phrases or verses that could be incorporated into your prayers.

#### Memorization of Key Prayer Passages

> "Scripture laid up in the memory furnishes us for prayer, and therefore should be daily conversed with."

Henry emphasized memorizing biblical passages particularly useful for prayer, creating an internal repository of God's Word to draw upon in prayer.

**Memory Project**: Select a prayer-rich passage (perhaps Psalm 103, Ephesians 1:15-23, or Colossians 1:9-14) to memorize over the next month. Each time you review it, consider how its phrases might be incorporated into your prayers.

#### Learning from Praying Communities

> "It is good to join in prayer with those who speak Scripturally, for their expressions may furnish us with matter for prayer, better than any form can."

Henry recognized the value of praying with others who naturally incorporate Scripture into their prayers, allowing their example to shape our own prayer language.

**Community Learning**: Pay special attention to how Scripture-saturated believers in your community pray. Note their patterns and phrases, and consider how you might incorporate similar biblical language into your own prayers.

## Methods for Incorporating Scripture into Daily Prayer

Drawing on the insights of both Boston and Henry, here are several practical methods for incorporating Scripture into your daily prayer life:

### 1. The Psalm-Prayer Method

The Psalms provide ready-made prayers covering the full range of human experience:

**Daily Practice**:
1. Select a psalm (perhaps following a sequential or thematic plan)
2. Read it slowly, noting its mood, concerns, and expressions
3. Pray through the psalm, section by section, personalizing its language
4. Add your own specific concerns that relate to each section
5. Conclude with thanks for how the psalm has given voice to your prayers

**Example Using Psalm 23**:
"Lord, you are my shepherd; help me trust that I lack nothing essential because of your care. Today I need your guidance in [specific situation]. Lead me beside quiet waters when I feel anxious about [specific concern]. Restore my soul when I feel depleted by [specific challenge]..."

### 2. The Promise-Mining Method

This approach focuses specifically on God's promises as fuel for prayer:

**Daily Practice**:
1. Identify a biblical promise relevant to your current circumstances
2. Thank God for making this promise
3. Express faith in God's character as the foundation of the promise
4. Present your specific need in light of the promise
5. Surrender to God's timing and method of fulfillment

**Example Using Philippians 4:19**:
"Father, you have promised to supply all my needs according to your riches in glory in Christ Jesus. Thank you for this assurance. You are a generous God who delights in caring for your children. I bring before you my current financial concerns [specific details]. I trust you to provide what I truly need in your perfect timing and way."

### 3. The Scripture-Expansion Method

This approach takes a brief biblical text and expands it into a fuller prayer:

**Daily Practice**:
1. Select a short Scripture verse or phrase
2. Use each key word or concept as a launching point for prayer
3. Develop each element with personal application
4. Connect the expanded prayer back to the original text

**Example Using Matthew 6:33**:
"Lord, you command me to seek first your kingdom and your righteousness. Help me to truly seek you above all else today, not just in words but in my priorities and choices. Show me what your kingdom looks like in my workplace, family, and personal life. Teach me your righteousness—what it means to live rightly in each relationship and decision today. I trust that as I focus on these primary concerns, you will provide everything else I need [specific needs] just as you've promised."

### 4. The Biblical-Pattern Method

This approach uses biblical prayer structures as templates:

**Daily Practice**:
1. Select a biblical prayer (e.g., the Lord's Prayer, one of Paul's prayers)
2. Identify its key elements and sequence
3. Use this structure as a framework for your own prayer
4. Fill in each section with your specific concerns while maintaining the biblical priorities

**Example Using Colossians 1:9-12**:
Pattern elements: Knowledge of God's will → Spiritual wisdom → Worthy life → Pleasing God → Bearing fruit → Growing in knowledge → Strengthened with power → Endurance and patience → Thanksgiving

"Father, I ask for knowledge of your will regarding my career decision, with all spiritual wisdom to understand the implications. Help me live a life worthy of you in my workplace, pleasing you in how I interact with colleagues. May my work bear fruit in practical ways that serve others. Strengthen me with your power when I face challenges in this project, giving me endurance and patience with difficult team members. Thank you for qualifying me to share in your inheritance through Christ."

## Techniques for Incorporating Biblical Language into Prayer

Beyond these structured methods, here are several techniques for naturally incorporating biblical language into your prayers:

### 1. Biblical Bookends

Begin and end prayers with biblical phrases that set a God-centered tone:

**Opening phrases**:
- "Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty" (Revelation 15:3)
- "To him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine" (Ephesians 3:20)
- "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name" (Matthew 6:9)

**Closing phrases**:
- "Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling" (Jude 24)
- "To the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ" (Romans 16:27)
- "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with my spirit" (Philippians 4:23)

### 2. Biblical Transitions

Use Scripture phrases to transition between different parts of prayer:

**Transitioning to confession**:
- "Search me, God, and know my heart" (Psalm 139:23)
- "Who can discern their own errors? Forgive my hidden faults" (Psalm 19:12)

**Transitioning to petition**:
- "Give ear to my words, O Lord, consider my sighing" (Psalm 5:1)
- "This is the confidence we have in approaching God" (1 John 5:14)

**Transitioning to thanksgiving**:
- "I will give thanks to you, Lord, with all my heart" (Psalm 9:1)
- "Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" (Ephesians 1:3)

### 3. Biblical Response Phrases

Develop the habit of responding to life situations with biblical phrases:

**When facing decisions**:
- "Show me your ways, Lord, teach me your paths" (Psalm 25:4)

**When experiencing anxiety**:
- "When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought me joy" (Psalm 94:19)

**When feeling grateful**:
- "Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever" (Psalm 107:1)

## Templates for Scripture-Based Prayer

To help you begin incorporating Scripture into your prayers immediately, here are three ready-to-use templates based on Puritan approaches:

### 1. Morning Prayer Template Based on Psalm 143:8-10

"Lord, let me hear of your unfailing love each morning, for I trust in you. Show me the way I should go today in my [specific responsibilities], for to you I entrust my life. Rescue me from my enemies, O Lord—from my sins, temptations, and spiritual opposition that seek to destroy me. I hide myself in you. Teach me to do your will in every interaction and decision today, for you are my God. May your good Spirit lead me on level ground through the challenges I anticipate in [specific situations]."

### 2. Evening Reflection Template Based on Psalm 4:1, 7-8

"Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness. Give me relief from my distress today; be merciful to me and hear my prayer. As I reflect on this day, you have filled my heart with greater joy than when earthly blessings abound. I will lie down and sleep in peace, for you alone, Lord, make me dwell in safety. Guard my mind from tomorrow's worries and grant me restful sleep, trusting in your faithful care."

### 3. Prayer for Spiritual Growth Based on Ephesians 3:16-19

"Father, I pray that out of your glorious riches you would strengthen me with power through your Spirit in my inner being today, especially as I face [specific challenge]. May Christ dwell in my heart through faith, becoming more evident in my words and actions. Root me and establish me in love, so that my interactions with [specific people] flow from your love rather than my own impatience or selfishness. Help me grasp how wide and long and high and deep is Christ's love, particularly when I struggle to love [specific person or situation]. May I know this love that surpasses knowledge, so that I may be filled to the measure with all your fullness rather than being consumed by [specific concern]."

## Conclusion: Prayer Shaped by the Word

The Puritan emphasis on Scripture-saturated prayer offers a remedy for many of our modern prayer struggles. When we don't know what to say, Scripture provides the words. When we're unsure if our prayers align with God's will, biblical patterns guide us. When our prayers feel shallow, Scripture's depth enriches them.

As Matthew Henry wrote: "When we pray in the words of Scripture and according to the pattern of Scripture, then surely we pray by the Spirit."

The Puritans would encourage us to see that incorporating Scripture into prayer isn't primarily about technique but relationship—allowing God's Word to shape our conversation with Him just as a deep friendship shapes our conversations with a close friend. We come to speak God's language because we have spent time listening to Him.

Thomas Boston beautifully captures the transformative power of this approach: "The more the Word dwells in us, the more we shall abound in prayer; the more we pray, the more we shall relish the Word... If these two are kept up in their vigor, the Christian shall doubtless thrive in other spiritual duties."

As you implement the practices in this chapter, may you discover the rich harmony that develops when God's Word and your prayers become inseparable companions.
