## The Musician's Method

Naomi settled at her piano, preparing to compose a piece for her graduate recital. As a classically trained musician, she didn't simply sit down and play whatever notes felt right. Instead, she surrounded herself with the works of Bach, Mozart, and Chopin—studying their patterns, absorbing their language, and allowing their genius to shape her own compositions.

Her professor often reminded her, "The greatest originality comes after you've thoroughly mastered the language of those who came before you."

This approach—immersing oneself in the language and patterns of masters—mirrors how the Puritans approached prayer. They believed that truly effective prayer doesn't come from merely speaking whatever words come to mind but from deeply absorbing the language, patterns, and priorities of Scripture.

As Thomas Boston (1676-1732) wrote: "The Word of God is the only rule to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy Him. The Spirit's sword must guide the Spirit's prayers." For Boston and his fellow Puritans, Scripture wasn't just one influence among many on their prayers—it was the primary source and authority for how they prayed.

## Thomas Boston: Using Scripture as Prayer's Foundation

Thomas Boston, a Scottish theologian and pastor, is best known for his work *Human Nature in its Fourfold State*. Though born slightly after the classic Puritan era, Boston thoroughly embraced and advanced Puritan approaches to biblically grounded prayer.

### Why Boston Emphasized Scripture in Prayer

For Boston, prayer disconnected from Scripture was vulnerable to several dangers:

> "Praying without the Word is like building without a foundation. Our prayers are only acceptable to God when they are according to His will, and His will is revealed in His Word."

Boston identified several risks of Scripture-less prayer:

1. **Self-centered focus** – Prayer becoming a wish list rather than God-centered worship
2. **Theological error** – Mistaken understandings of God's character or promises
3. **Limited scope** – Prayers narrowed to personal concerns rather than God's kingdom purposes
4. **Weakened faith** – Praying without standing on God's promises

**Reflection Question**: When have you experienced the difference between prayers formed by your immediate desires versus prayers shaped by Scripture? How did these prayer experiences differ?

### Boston's Methods for Scripture-Guided Prayer

Boston offered several practical approaches for allowing Scripture to shape prayer:

#### 1. Praying the Promises

> "The promises are the wells of salvation from which you may draw water with joy; they are the breasts of consolation from which you may suck and be satisfied."

Boston encouraged believers to:
- Identify specific promises relevant to their situations
- Plead these promises directly in prayer
- Rest their faith on God's faithfulness to His Word

He argued that when we pray God's promises, we align our requests with His revealed will.

**Practical Application**: Create a "promise inventory" by identifying 5-7 biblical promises that relate to your current circumstances. Before each prayer time, review one promise and incorporate it specifically into your prayers.

#### 2. Using Scripture's Prayer Patterns

Boston recommended studying the structure of biblical prayers:

> "In the Lord's Prayer, we have a perfect pattern for prayer given by Him who best knows what we should pray for and how we should pray. Study its parts, its order, its scope."

He suggested:
- Noting the balance between worship and petition in biblical prayers
- Observing how biblical figures approached God
- Learning from both the content and structure of scriptural prayers

**Group Exercise**: Read Daniel 9:4-19 together. Identify the components of Daniel's prayer (confession, appeal to God's character, petition, etc.). Discuss how this pattern might inform your own prayers, particularly in times of crisis or national concern.

#### 3. Allowing Scripture to Guide Prayer Topics

Boston observed that our natural prayer concerns are often too narrow:

> "We know not what we should pray for as we ought, and are apt to ask amiss. But the Word teaches us what to pray for, giving us a compass for our prayers, that we may not wander into strange petitions."

He encouraged:
- Using Scripture to expand prayer beyond personal concerns
- Praying through biblical themes often neglected in spontaneous prayer
- Allowing Scripture to correct our natural prayer tendencies

**Self-Examination**: Consider your prayers over the past week. What biblical themes or concerns have been absent from your prayers? (Examples might include God's glory, kingdom advancement, spiritual warfare, or specific virtues emphasized in Scripture.)

### Boston's Practical Approach to Praying Scripture

Boston offered practical guidance for making Scripture central to prayer:

#### The Text-to-Prayer Method

> "After reading God's Word, turn it into prayer. Make the Scripture a ladder by which your thoughts and affections may climb up to God."

Boston suggested this approach:
1. Read a portion of Scripture attentively
2. Meditate on its main truths
3. Turn each significant point into prayer—either praise, confession, or petition
4. Continue this pattern through the passage

**Practical Exercise**: Take Psalm 23 and practice Boston's method. Read one verse, identify its main truth, and then form a brief prayer based on that truth before moving to the next verse.

#### The Bible-Before-Prayer Rhythm

> "Let prayer be the key of the morning and the bolt of the evening, but let the Word be the guide of both."

Boston encouraged:
- Reading Scripture before prayer times
- Allowing the day's Bible reading to shape prayer concerns
- Returning to the morning's text throughout the day in prayer

**Daily Habit Suggestion**: Place your Bible open to the day's reading next to where you pray. Begin prayer time by reading the passage, then allow it to shape your prayers.

## Matthew Henry: Mastering Biblical Language in Prayer

Matthew Henry (1662-1714) is most famous for his Commentary on the Whole Bible, which reveals his deep integration of Scripture into every aspect of the Christian life, especially prayer.

### Henry's View of Scripture's Role in Prayer

For Henry, Scripture was not merely a source of prayer topics but the very language that should form our prayers:

> "When we pray with our hearts full of the Word, we pray most comfortably, most profitably, and most acceptably."

Henry believed there were several benefits to incorporating biblical language into prayer:

1. **Greater confidence** – Using God's own words back to Him
2. **Deeper reverence** – Employing fitting language for approaching God
3. **Fuller expression** – Finding words for experiences we struggle to articulate
4. **Spiritual alignment** – Allowing Scripture to reshape our desires and perspectives

**Journaling Prompt**: Recall a difficult situation where you struggled to find words to pray. Looking back, what biblical passages or phrases might have helped you express your heart to God?

### Henry's Approaches to Biblical Prayer Language

Henry developed several methods for incorporating biblical language into prayer:

#### 1. Biblical Phrasing in Everyday Prayer

> "Scripture expressions are the language of the Spirit, and to use them in prayer is to speak in the Spirit's language."

Henry encouraged:
- Memorizing key scriptural phrases and prayers
- Deliberately incorporating biblical language into spontaneous prayer
- Letting biblical patterns reshape our typical prayer vocabulary

**Practical Step**: Choose 3-5 short biblical phrases that particularly speak to you (e.g., "your steadfast love endures forever," "lead me in paths of righteousness"). Write them on a card and keep it with you, intentionally incorporating these phrases into your daily prayers.

#### 2. Praying Through Biblical Categories

Henry's own published prayers reveal his practice of organizing prayer according to biblical categories:

> "A well-ordered prayer follows the pattern God has given us in His Word. We should adore Him for who He is, confess what we are, thank Him for what He has done, and ask Him for what He has promised."

He suggested:
- Structuring prayer around biblical patterns
- Including all the elements Scripture models
- Using biblical categories to expand beyond our typical concerns

**Group Discussion Question**: How might following Henry's approach to prayer categories (adoration, confession, thanksgiving, supplication) change your prayer life? Which categories do you tend to neglect in your prayers?

#### 3. Themed Scripture Prayer

Henry compiled what he called his *Method for Prayer*, organizing biblical phrases around various prayer themes. He explained:

> "The more we acquaint ourselves with the Scriptures, the better we shall speak the language of Zion... Let the word of Christ dwell richly in you, and furnish you for every good work, especially for the good work of prayer."

His approach included:
- Collecting scriptural phrases relating to specific themes
- Organizing them in a usable format
- Drawing from these collections in prayer

**Practical Suggestion**: Choose one theme important to your current circumstances (e.g., guidance, comfort, strength, forgiveness). Spend 15 minutes finding 7-10 verses addressing this theme. Compile these verses as a prayer resource to use in the coming week.

### Henry's "Method for Prayer"

Henry's most direct contribution to biblically grounded prayer was his book *A Method for Prayer*, which essentially provided a template of scriptural expressions organized for prayer. Here's how Henry suggested using his method:

#### Adapt Rather Than Merely Recite

> "These forms of prayer are not to be imposed or prescribed, but merely to be proposed and recommended... The intention was to put expressions into the mouths of those who needed them, that their hearts might be affected with them."

Henry believed in:
- Using his scriptural prayer compilations as starting points
- Adapting biblical language to personal circumstances
- Allowing biblical patterns to gradually reshape spontaneous prayer

**Practical Exercise**: Read through one of Henry's prayer templates (available online or in republished editions of *A Method for Prayer*). Choose a section that resonates with your current situation. Pray through it slowly, pausing to personalize each scriptural phrase.

#### The Power of Preparation

> "Though we are taught not to be anxious in prayer, we are taught to be thoughtful; though we must pray with the Spirit, yet we must pray with the understanding also."

Henry encouraged:
- Thoughtful preparation before prayer
- Selecting appropriate scriptural language
- Balancing preparation with Spirit-led spontaneity

**Self-Examination**: In what ways might lack of preparation hinder your prayers? How could intentional preparation with Scripture enhance your prayer life without becoming formulaic?

## Practical Methods for Incorporating Scripture into Prayer

Drawing from both Boston and Henry, here are several structured approaches to biblically grounded prayer:

### 1. The Psalm Immersion Method

**Purpose**: To use the Bible's prayer book as a template for your own prayers

**Method**:
1. Select a psalm that reflects your current emotional or spiritual state
2. Read it slowly, noting its movement and structure
3. Paraphrase each section in your own words as a personal prayer
4. Add your specific circumstances to the psalm's framework
5. Conclude with the psalm's final thoughts, usually of trust or praise

**Biblical Basis**: The psalmists themselves often adapted earlier psalms for new situations.

**Time Required**: 10-15 minutes

### 2. The Biblical Lens Approach

**Purpose**: To view your specific concerns through biblical perspectives

**Method**:
1. Write down a specific prayer concern
2. Identify 3-4 biblical passages that address this type of concern
3. Read each passage, noting how Scripture frames this issue
4. Restate your prayer request incorporating these biblical insights
5. Note how your understanding of your need may have shifted

**Example**: A prayer for healing might be transformed by passages about God's sovereignty (Job 1:21), spiritual growth through suffering (James 1:2-4), and Christ's sufficiency in weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9-10).

**Time Required**: 15-20 minutes

### 3. The Bible Chapter Prayer Expansion

**Purpose**: To expand prayer beyond personal concerns using Scripture's breadth

**Method**:
1. Select any chapter from the Bible
2. Read it attentively
3. For each verse or key thought, develop a brief prayer:
   - Verses about God's attributes → praise
   - Commands/instructions → commitment
   - Promises → thanksgiving
   - Warnings → confession
4. Move through the entire chapter this way

**Puritan Connection**: This was a favorite method of Puritan pastor and author Joseph Alleine (1634-1668).

**Time Required**: 20-30 minutes

### 4. The Lord's Prayer Expansion

**Purpose**: To use Christ's model prayer as a framework for comprehensive prayer

**Method**:
1. Take each phrase of the Lord's Prayer in turn
2. Spend 2-3 minutes expanding on that phrase in your own words
3. Apply the principle behind each petition to your specific circumstances
4. Add scriptural promises or commands related to each section
5. Move through the entire prayer

**Example**: "Give us this day our daily bread" might expand to include prayers about physical needs, gratitude for God's provision, requests for contentment, and dependence on God for sustenance of all kinds.

**Time Required**: 15-20 minutes

## Templates for Scripture-Based Prayer

Here are several templates inspired by Matthew Henry's approach, using scriptural language organized around common prayer needs:

### A Prayer for Guidance Using Biblical Language

> Sovereign Lord, You have promised to instruct me and teach me in the way I should go, to counsel me with Your eye upon me (Psalm 32:8). I acknowledge that the way of man is not in himself; it is not in me who walks to direct my steps (Jeremiah 10:23).
>
> I pray that You would make me to know Your ways, O Lord; teach me Your paths. Lead me in Your truth and teach me, for You are the God of my salvation; for You I wait all the day long (Psalm 25:4-5).
>
> When I turn to the right or to the left, may I hear Your voice behind me, saying, "This is the way, walk in it" (Isaiah 30:21). Order my steps in Your word, and let no iniquity have dominion over me (Psalm 119:133).
>
> I trust in You with all my heart, and lean not on my own understanding. In all my ways I acknowledge You; now direct my paths (Proverbs 3:5-6). Let Your light and Your truth lead me; let them bring me to Your holy hill and to Your dwelling (Psalm 43:3).
>
> Through Jesus Christ, who is the way, the truth, and the life. Amen.

### A Prayer in Times of Anxiety Using Scripture

> O Lord, hear me as I cry, "Cast your burden on the Lord, and he will sustain you; he will never permit the righteous to be moved" (Psalm 55:22).
>
> You have instructed me not to be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving to let my requests be made known to You. And You have promised that Your peace, which surpasses all understanding, will guard my heart and mind in Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:6-7).
>
> When my anxious thoughts multiply within me, let Your consolations cheer my soul (Psalm 94:19). Remind me to cast all my anxieties on You, because You care for me (1 Peter 5:7).
>
> Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me (Psalm 23:4). Let not my heart be troubled; help me believe in God and also in Christ (John 14:1).
>
> In Your name I pray, knowing that the peace You leave with me is not as the world gives (John 14:27). Amen.

## Methods for Incorporating Scripture into Daily Prayer

Here are practical approaches for making Scripture central to your ongoing prayer life:

### The Morning Scripture-Prayer Integration

**Purpose**: To begin the day with biblically shaped prayer

**Method**:
1. Read a short Scripture passage (perhaps from a reading plan)
2. Note one key insight about God's character or promises
3. Write a one-sentence prayer incorporating this insight
4. Return to this prayer several times throughout the day
5. End the day by reflecting on how this truth shaped your perspective

**Puritan Connection**: Richard Baxter advocated a similar approach in his *Christian Directory*.

**Time Required**: 5-7 minutes in the morning, brief moments throughout the day

### The Bible-Before-Request Practice

**Purpose**: To align personal requests with scriptural priorities

**Method**:
1. Before bringing specific requests to God, read a relevant biblical passage
2. Allow that passage to shape how you frame your request
3. Consider how your initial desire might need adjustment in light of Scripture
4. Present your request in biblical language when possible
5. End by affirming trust in God's wisdom revealed in His Word

**Daily Application**: Keep a small Bible or collection of key verses with your prayer list. For each major prayer concern, identify at least one relevant Scripture.

**Time Required**: 2-3 minutes per request

### The Weekly Scripture Prayer Focus

**Purpose**: To develop depth in praying Scripture over time

**Method**:
1. Choose one Bible chapter to focus on for an entire week
2. Read it completely on Monday, noting key themes
3. Each subsequent day, focus on a different section of the chapter
4. Pray that section in detail, incorporating its language and truths
5. By the end of the week, you'll have prayed through the entire chapter deeply

**Recommendation**: Start with psalms, apostolic prayers (like Ephesians 1:15-23), or narrative passages rich in prayer examples.

**Time Required**: 10 minutes daily

## Reflection Questions

1. In what ways has your prayer life been disconnected from Scripture? What might change if your prayers became more thoroughly biblical in both content and language?

2. Which of Thomas Boston's approaches to Scripture-guided prayer seems most helpful for your current spiritual season, and why?

3. Matthew Henry emphasized the importance of biblical language in prayer. How might this emphasis correct tendencies in contemporary prayer practices?

4. What Scripture passages have most shaped your prayers in the past? Why did these particular passages impact you so deeply?

5. How might you balance Boston's emphasis on praying Scripture's content with Henry's focus on using Scripture's language in a way that keeps prayer both biblical and authentically personal?

## A Scripture-Shaped Prayer

> Gracious Father,
> 
> You who have given us Your Word as a lamp to our feet
> and a light to our path (Psalm 119:105),
> teach us to pray not according to our own imaginations
> but according to Your perfect will revealed in Scripture.
> 
> We confess that our prayers often spring from unexamined desires
> rather than from minds renewed by Your Word (Romans 12:2).
> Forgive us for approaching You with many words (Matthew 6:7)
> but little understanding of who You are and what You desire.
> 
> Like Thomas Boston, help us build our prayers
> on the firm foundation of Your promises,
> that we might pray with confidence, knowing that
> if we ask anything according to Your will, You hear us (1 John 5:14).
> 
> Like Matthew Henry, may we so treasure Your Word
> that its language becomes our own,
> that we might pray in the Spirit and understand with the mind (1 Corinthians 14:15).
> 
> May our prayers increasingly reflect not our passing whims
> but Your eternal purposes; not our limited perspective
> but Your perfect wisdom; not our faltering words
> but Your unchanging truth.
> 
> Through Jesus Christ, who taught us to pray
> and intercedes for us according to Your will (Romans 8:34). Amen.
