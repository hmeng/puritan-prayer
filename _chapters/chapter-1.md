## The Call to Prayer

In our fast-paced modern world, prayer often feels like a luxury we can't afford. We rush from commitment to commitment, our minds filled with tasks, worries, and distractions. Finding time for quiet contemplation seems nearly impossible. Yet the Puritans—who lived in their own turbulent times—insistently remind us that prayer isn't optional for the Christian life. It's absolutely essential.

As John Bunyan (1628-1688), author of *The Pilgrim's Progress*, bluntly put it: "Prayer will make a man cease from sin, or sin will entice a man to cease from prayer." The Puritans understood that prayer isn't merely a religious duty but our lifeline to God—as necessary for our souls as breathing is for our bodies.

## The Urgency of Prayer: John Bunyan's Perspective

John Bunyan knew about urgency in prayer. Having spent twelve years in prison for his faith, he wrote one of the most profound works on prayer during his confinement, titled *Prayer: What It Is, and What It Does*. For Bunyan, prayer wasn't a casual conversation but a desperate plea from a needy soul to a generous God.

> "Prayer is a sincere, sensible, affectionate pouring out of the heart or soul to God, through Christ, in the strength and assistance of the Holy Spirit, for such things as God has promised, or according to his Word, for the good of the church, with submission in faith to the will of God."

This rich definition reveals several key insights about prayer's necessity:

### 1. Prayer Flows from Genuine Need

Bunyan describes prayer as "sincere" and "sensible"—meaning it arises from real, felt needs. He believed that recognizing our spiritual poverty is the starting point for meaningful prayer. In his words:

> "The best prayers have often more groans than words."

**Practical Application**: Begin your prayers by honestly assessing your need for God. Don't rush to petition before acknowledging your dependence. Ask yourself: "What areas of my life am I trying to manage without God's help?"

### 2. Prayer Engages the Whole Person

Notice that Bunyan describes prayer as "affectionate pouring out of the heart or soul." True prayer isn't merely intellectual—it engages our emotions and desires. The Puritans believed that prayer should involve the whole person.

**Reflection Question**: When was the last time you prayed with deep feeling? What prevents you from emotionally engaging with God in prayer?

### 3. Prayer Requires Divine Assistance

Bunyan acknowledges that effective prayer happens "through Christ, in the strength and assistance of the Holy Spirit." This reveals a profound understanding—that we need God's help even to pray to God!

**Prayer Exercise**: Before your next prayer time, spend a minute asking the Holy Spirit to help you pray. Notice how this simple act changes your prayer experience.

## The Indispensability of Prayer: John Owen's View

John Owen (1616-1683), often considered the greatest Puritan theologian, emphasized prayer's indispensable role in spiritual life. Unlike Bunyan's experiential approach, Owen offered systematic insights on why prayer is essential.

### 1. Prayer as Communion with God

For Owen, prayer wasn't primarily about getting things from God but enjoying relationship with Him. In his work *Communion with God*, he writes:

> "What greater privilege than to be admitted into conference and communion with the great and holy God, to treat with him about the things of our eternal concernment!"

Owen believed that prayer's primary purpose was communion—the direct fellowship between the believer and God. This makes prayer not just important but irreplaceable, as it's the primary way we experience relationship with our Creator.

**Practical Exercise**: Set aside 10 minutes for prayer that doesn't ask for anything. Simply focus on God's presence and expressing your love for Him.

### 2. Prayer as Spiritual Warfare

Owen, who wrote extensively on temptation and spiritual conflict, saw prayer as essential equipment for spiritual battle:

> "Be much in prayer. This is the first and principal part of our defense against temptation. 'Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation.'"

According to Owen, neglecting prayer leaves us vulnerable to spiritual attack and moral failure. Just as a soldier wouldn't enter battle without armor, the Christian shouldn't face daily challenges without prayer.

**Group Discussion Question**: How have you experienced prayer as a defense against temptation or spiritual attack? Share a specific example.

### 3. Prayer as the Breath of Faith

Perhaps most fundamentally, Owen taught that prayer is to faith what breathing is to life—the natural expression and sustenance of spiritual vitality:

> "A man may as well think to see without eyes, or live without breath, as to maintain faith without prayer."

This metaphor powerfully illustrates prayer's necessity. Just as breathing happens naturally for a living person, prayer flows naturally from genuine faith.

**Self-Examination**: If prayer is faith's breathing, what does your prayer life reveal about your spiritual health? Is your faith breathing deeply or gasping for air?

## Cultivating a Burden for Consistent Prayer

Understanding prayer's necessity intellectually isn't enough—we need to feel its importance. The Puritans spoke of developing a "burden" for prayer—a deep conviction of its value that compels us to make it a priority. How can we cultivate this?

### 1. Meditate on Scripture's Commands

The Bible repeatedly commands prayer, from Jesus' instruction to "always pray and not give up" (Luke 18:1) to Paul's exhortation to "pray without ceasing" (1 Thessalonians 5:17). The Puritans recommended regularly meditating on these commands until they shaped our convictions.

### 2. Remember Prayer's Benefits

Richard Sibbes (1577-1635), another prominent Puritan, encouraged believers to recall the benefits they'd received through prayer:

> "Let us call to mind the former experiences of God's hearing our prayers, set them before us, and never forget them... Nothing more strengthens faith than experience."

**Journal Prompt**: List three specific times when God answered your prayers. How do these memories affect your motivation to pray now?

### 3. Establish Prayer Habits

The Puritans believed that discipline precedes delight. They recommended establishing regular prayer habits, trusting that consistent practice would eventually kindle deeper desire.

**Practical Challenge**: Commit to a specific time for prayer each day this week, even if just for 10 minutes. Note how your perception of prayer's importance changes through consistent practice.

## Conclusion: A Call to Action

The Puritan understanding of prayer's necessity isn't meant to burden us with guilt but to invite us into a richer experience of God. Their insights challenge us to move beyond viewing prayer as an optional spiritual supplement and to recognize it as the lifeblood of authentic faith.

As we close this chapter, consider Bunyan's challenge: "He who runs from God in the morning will scarcely find Him the rest of the day." Today is an opportunity to renew your commitment to this essential spiritual practice.
