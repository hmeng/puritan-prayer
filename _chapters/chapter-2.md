## The Gardener's Approach

Maria knelt by her garden bed, carefully testing the soil with her fingers. Too compact—it would need loosening. She added compost, working it in gently, preparing the ground before planting a single seed. Her neighbor often teased her about the time she spent preparing soil, but Maria knew the secret to her thriving garden wasn't just in the planting or watering—it was in the preparation.

The Puritans approached prayer with similar wisdom. They knew that rushing into prayer with unprepared hearts was like scattering seeds on hard, rocky ground. For them, preparation wasn't an optional extra but essential groundwork for meaningful communion with God.

As Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758), who carried the Puritan tradition into the 18th century, wrote: "The religious affections are the spring of all true religion in the heart." The Puritans understood that our hearts—our inner disposition and affections—profoundly influence our prayers.

## Jonathan Edwards on Spiritual Affections

Though Edwards came slightly after the classic Puritan era, he articulated and developed their understanding of how emotions (what he called "affections") relate to genuine spiritual experience, including prayer.

In his influential work, *A Treatise Concerning Religious Affections*, Edwards drew an important distinction: true spiritual experience isn't merely intellectual knowledge, nor is it raw emotion detached from truth. Instead, it involves "affections"—deep inclinations of the heart that combine understanding, emotion, and will.

### The Nature of True Spiritual Affections

For Edwards, genuine spiritual affections:

1. **Arise from divine illumination** – They come from a true spiritual understanding of God's glory, not just emotional stimulation

2. **Center on God's excellence** – They focus on God's intrinsic beauty, not just his benefits to us

3. **Transform the whole person** – They change not just feelings but character and conduct

Edwards wrote: "True religion, in great part, consists in holy affections." But he was equally clear that not all religious emotions are trustworthy. Some feelings might be merely natural emotional responses or even counterfeit spiritual experiences.

**Practical Implication**: Before prayer, Edwards would encourage us to examine not just what we know about God but our heart's attitude toward Him. Do we come merely out of duty, or with affections properly stirred by His goodness and majesty?

### How Edwards Would Guide Our Prayer Preparation

If Edwards were advising us today, he might suggest these preparatory practices:

1. **Meditate on God's attributes** – Reflect on His goodness, wisdom, power, and love until your heart warms to these truths

2. **Confront competing affections** – Identify what else your heart loves that might be displacing love for God

3. **Seek the Spirit's illumination** – Ask God to help you see His beauty more clearly, knowing that true affections arise from spiritual perception

**Exercise**: Before your next prayer time, spend 5 minutes meditating on one attribute of God (His faithfulness, wisdom, etc.). Note how this reflection shapes your approach to prayer.

## The Puritan Practice of Heart Preparation

While Edwards provided the theological framework, other Puritan writers offered practical guidance for preparing the heart for prayer.

### Thomas Brooks: Guarding Against Distractions

Thomas Brooks (1608-1680) recognized that the unprepared heart would inevitably be plagued by distractions. In *Precious Remedies Against Satan's Devices*, he wrote:

> "When you come to pray, you should say to your heart: 'O my heart, be serious now; this is no time to trifle with God.'"

Brooks suggested several practices to guard the heart before prayer:

1. **Recognize the solemnity** – Remind yourself you are approaching the King of kings

2. **Set a watch on wandering thoughts** – Acknowledge distractions will come and commit to redirecting them

3. **Pray for focus before you pray** – Ask God to gather your scattered thoughts

**Reflection Question**: What are your most common distractions during prayer? How might acknowledging these before you begin praying help guard against them?

### Richard Sibbes: Warming the Heart

Richard Sibbes, known as "the sweet dropper" for his gentle style, emphasized warming the heart before prayer. In *The Bruised Reed*, he wrote:

> "We should endeavor to have our hearts warmed with the things we are to speak of, that we may speak to God from our hearts."

Sibbes suggested these practices:

1. **Remember God's gracious invitation** – Reflect on God's willingness to hear you

2. **Recall past mercies** – Bring to mind specific ways God has shown faithfulness to you

3. **Use Scripture to kindle affection** – Read passages that speak of God's love and care

**Group Discussion Question**: Share an experience when recalling God's past faithfulness made a significant difference in your approach to prayer. How did it change your prayers?

## The Role of Scripture in Heart Preparation

For the Puritans, Scripture was essential in preparing the heart for prayer. They practiced what we might call a "Scripture-soaked" approach to prayer preparation.

### Matthew Henry: Scripture as the Prayer Primer

Matthew Henry emphasized using Scripture to shape one's heart for prayer. He believed the Bible should guide not just what we pray for but how we approach God.

In his *Method for Prayer*, Henry provided Scripture-based templates that believers could use to properly frame their hearts. He wrote:

> "When we pray with our hearts full of the Word, we pray most comfortably, most profitably, and most acceptably."

Henry's approach suggests:

1. **Read Scripture before prayer** – Let the Bible's truths and tone shape your heart

2. **Meditate on appropriate passages** – Choose texts that align with your prayer needs

3. **Borrow biblical language** – Use Scripture's own words to express your heart

**Practical Exercise**: Before prayer, read Psalm 103:1-5. Meditate on the blessings it enumerates. Then begin your prayer by expressing gratitude for these specific blessings in your own life.

### Thomas Watson: Scripture as Heart-Examiner

Thomas Watson viewed Scripture as a mirror that prepares us for prayer by showing us our true condition. In *The Doctrine of Repentance*, he wrote:

> "The Word discovers our disease, prayer procures the remedy."

Watson recommended:

1. **Allow Scripture to examine you** – Read with openness to conviction about sin

2. **Let the Bible diagnose spiritual needs** – Use it to identify what to pray for

3. **Find promises that address your condition** – Let these shape your requests

**Self-Examination**: Read James 4:1-10 and allow it to examine your heart. What does this passage reveal about potential attitudes or sins that might hinder your prayers?

## Addressing Modern Obstacles to Heart Preparation

The Puritans lived in a different era, but their wisdom speaks directly to our contemporary challenges in preparing for prayer.

### Obstacle 1: Digital Distraction

Our constant connectivity makes the quiet preparation the Puritans valued nearly impossible for many of us.

**Puritan-Inspired Solution**: Create a digital boundary around prayer times. Richard Baxter advocated for a separate "prayer closet"—a dedicated space for communion with God. Our equivalent might be shutting off notifications and designating a distraction-free zone.

**Practical Step**: Before prayer, put your devices in another room or on "do not disturb" for at least 15 minutes. Notice how this affects your ability to prepare your heart.

### Obstacle 2: Hurried Schedules

Our packed schedules leave little room for the unhurried heart preparation the Puritans practiced.

**Puritan-Inspired Solution**: John Owen spoke of "stated times" for prayer—regular, protected periods. For us, this means intentionally scheduling not just prayer time but preparation time.

**Practical Step**: Add 5-10 minutes of "heart preparation" time before your regular prayer times. Use this specifically to transition your mind and heart from daily activities to communion with God.

### Obstacle 3: Emotional Disconnection

Our culture often teaches us to disconnect from deeper emotions, making it difficult to engage our affections as the Puritans encouraged.

**Puritan-Inspired Solution**: Jonathan Edwards practiced what he called "soliloquy"—talking to his own soul about spiritual matters. This self-conversation helped reconnect him to his spiritual affections.

**Practical Step**: Before prayer, ask yourself: "Soul, what are you feeling toward God right now? What is keeping you from full engagement with Him?" Write down your responses as a way to reconnect with your emotional state.

## Exercises for Cultivating Receptivity Before Prayer

Based on Puritan practices, here are three exercises to help prepare your heart for prayer:

### 1. The Scripture Immersion

**Purpose**: To allow God's Word to shape your heart before prayer.

**Method**: 
- Select a short passage (5-10 verses) related to prayer or God's character
- Read it slowly three times
- First reading: Simply absorb the words
- Second reading: Note what stands out to you
- Third reading: Consider how this truth should shape your approach to God
- Begin your prayer by responding to the passage

**Time Required**: 5-7 minutes

### 2. The Affection Examination

**Purpose**: To recognize and align your heart's affections before prayer.

**Method**:
- Sit quietly for 3 minutes, attending to your current emotional state
- Ask yourself: "What am I feeling most strongly right now?"
- Consider: "How might these feelings be affecting my approach to God?"
- Acknowledge these emotions to God as you begin prayer
- If your emotions are drawing you away from God, ask for His help in reorienting your heart

**Time Required**: 3-5 minutes

### 3. The Gratitude Gateway

**Purpose**: To warm the heart through thankfulness.

**Method**:
- Take a piece of paper and write down 3-5 specific evidences of God's goodness in your life
- For each item, write one sentence about why it matters to you
- Express gratitude for these before making any requests in prayer
- Return to this list if your mind wanders during prayer

**Time Required**: 5 minutes

## Reflection Questions

1. What difference have you noticed between times when you've rushed into prayer versus times when you've prepared your heart first?

2. Which of the Puritan writers' approaches to heart preparation resonates most with you and why?

3. What competing "affections" (using Edwards' terminology) most often distract your heart from fully engaging with God in prayer?

4. How might you adapt the Puritan practice of heart preparation to fit your personality and circumstances?

5. What would need to change in your schedule or habits to allow for more intentional preparation before prayer?

## A Puritan Prayer of Preparation

This prayer, adapted from various Puritan sources, can help prepare your heart before entering into extended prayer:

> Gracious Father,
> 
> I come before You acknowledging my need for preparation.
> Too often I rush into Your presence
> with cluttered mind and cold heart.
> 
> Awaken my spiritual affections now.
> Warm my heart with the wonder of Your love.
> Quiet my racing thoughts.
> Focus my scattered attention.
> 
> By Your Spirit, help me to see Your beauty.
> By Your Word, align my desires with Yours.
> By Your grace, make me present to You
> as You are present to me.
> 
> I approach You now not based on my preparation
> but on Christ's perfect mediation.
> Yet prepare me to receive the grace
> You so freely give.
> 
> In Jesus' name, Amen.
