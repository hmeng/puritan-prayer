## The Discipline of Heart Preparation

When was the last time you rushed into an important conversation unprepared? Perhaps a job interview, a difficult discussion with a loved one, or a presentation to colleagues? Most of us recognize that significant interactions require preparation. Yet when it comes to prayer—our conversation with the Creator of the universe—we often dive in with little thought or preparation.

The Puritans saw this tendency in their own time. They believed that the quality of our prayers depends largely on the preparation of our hearts. As Thomas Brooks (1608-1680) observed: "The heart must be prepared for prayer, as the ground is for seed." This chapter explores the Puritan understanding of heart preparation and offers practical guidance for cultivating receptivity in our own prayer lives.

## Jonathan Edwards on Spiritual Affections in Prayer

Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758), though slightly later than the earlier Puritans, represents the culmination of Puritan thought on spiritual experience. His masterwork, *A Treatise Concerning Religious Affections*, provides profound insights into the role of affections—what we might call emotions or dispositions—in authentic spiritual life, particularly prayer.

### 1. Understanding True Spiritual Affections

Edwards distinguished between mere emotions and true "spiritual affections." He wrote:

> "True religion, in great part, consists in holy affections... The holy Scriptures place much of religion in godly fear... [and] in holy love."

For Edwards, genuine prayer isn't about generating intense feelings but cultivating proper spiritual dispositions: reverence, love, joy, and holy desire. These affections don't come naturally to our fallen hearts—they require deliberate cultivation.

**Reflection Question**: What emotions or attitudes typically characterize your prayers? Which spiritual affections might you need to cultivate more intentionally?

### 2. The Source of Holy Affections

Edwards emphasized that we cannot manufacture authentic spiritual affections through our own effort. They are, at root, the work of the Holy Spirit:

> "The Spirit of God is given to the true saints to dwell in them, as his proper lasting abode; and to influence their hearts, as a principle of new nature, or as a divine supernatural spring of life and action."

This insight offers both humility and hope as we prepare for prayer. We can't force the right feelings, but we can position ourselves to receive what only the Spirit can give.

**Prayer Exercise**: Before beginning your prayer time, pause to invite the Holy Spirit to awaken proper affections in your heart. Ask specifically for the gift of holy reverence and love.

### 3. Meditation as Preparation

Edwards practiced and taught extensive meditation before prayer. In his *Directions for Judging of Persons' Experiences*, he wrote:

> "Retire frequently for secret prayer and meditation. Conversing much with your own heart... will be the way to have a good acquaintance with your own heart and to know your own state."

For Edwards, meditation meant sustained reflection on Scripture, divine attributes, or one's spiritual condition. This practice doesn't come easily in our distracted age, but it remains essential for heart preparation.

**Practical Application**: Before prayer, spend 5-10 minutes meditating on a single verse of Scripture or attribute of God. Notice how this focused preparation changes your prayer experience.

## Puritan Practices for Heart Preparation

Beyond Edwards' insights, other Puritan writers offered practical guidance for preparing the heart for prayer. Their approaches, while varied, share common elements we can adapt for today.

### 1. Self-Examination: Clearing Away Obstacles

Richard Baxter (1615-1691) emphasized self-examination as a crucial preparatory step for prayer:

> "Take heed to all the frame of your hearts, and to the method of your own thoughts... Examine yourselves: without self-knowledge, you can have neither repentance, nor faith, nor humility, nor thankfulness."

The Puritans regularly practiced self-examination to identify sin, distractions, or improper motivations that might hinder prayer. This wasn't about fostering unhealthy introspection but clearing away obstacles to communion with God.

**Guided Practice**: Before your next prayer time, ask yourself these three questions:
- What sins do I need to confess before approaching God?
- What worries or distractions do I need to set aside?
- What false motives might be driving my prayers today?

### 2. Contemplating God's Character: Cultivating Reverence

Thomas Watson (c.1620-1686) taught that contemplating God's attributes was essential preparation for prayer:

> "When you are about to pray, get a due and right apprehension of God's majesty and glory... If a king were on his throne, and you should come and turn your back on him and talk with someone else, would he not interpret this as contempt? Yet this is our behavior towards the great God!"

The Puritans knew that familiarity can breed contempt—even in our relationship with God. Intentional reflection on God's holiness, power, wisdom, and love cultivates the reverence that marks meaningful prayer.

**Meditation Exercise**: Choose one attribute of God (holiness, wisdom, faithfulness, etc.). Spend five minutes reflecting on this attribute, considering both Scripture passages that reveal it and examples from your own experience.

### 3. Scripture Reading: Tuning the Heart

John Bunyan advised Scripture reading as a means of tuning the heart for prayer:

> "The Holy Scriptures are of use to us in prayer, for therein we find both encouragement and exhortation thereto; its difficulties solved and removed; its aid and assistance promised, and blessed examples of the grace of prayer."

For the Puritans, Scripture and prayer were inseparable companions. Bible reading wasn't just about gaining information but preparing the heart by aligning our thoughts with God's revealed truth.

**Group Discussion Question**: How has Scripture reading influenced your prayers? Can you identify specific passages that have shaped your understanding of prayer or given you words when your own were inadequate?

## Addressing Obstacles to Heart Preparation in Modern Life

The Puritans faced their own challenges to prayer—persecution, political upheaval, and physical hardship. Yet our modern context presents unique obstacles to heart preparation that they couldn't have anticipated.

### 1. Digital Distraction

Our constant connectivity through smartphones and other devices creates unprecedented challenges for developing the focused attention prayer requires. Research suggests that even the presence of a smartphone reduces cognitive capacity and attention.

**Practical Strategy**: Create a "digital boundary" around your prayer time. Turn devices off or place them in another room. Consider using a physical Bible rather than a digital one for pre-prayer Scripture reading.

### 2. Hurry and Busyness

In his book *The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry*, John Mark Comer identifies hurry as the great enemy of spiritual life in our age. The Puritans would agree. They practiced what they called "holy leisure"—intentional spaces of unhurried time with God.

**Countercultural Practice**: Schedule prayer appointments in your calendar, making them at least 25% longer than you think necessary. This margin prevents rushing and allows space for proper heart preparation.

### 3. Emotional Numbness

Many of us live with a degree of emotional disconnection—a defense mechanism in a world of overwhelming information and stimulation. This numbness makes Edwards' emphasis on "holy affections" particularly challenging.

**Healing Exercise**: In preparation for prayer, practice emotional honesty by completing these sentences:
- "Right now I feel..."
- "What I really want is..."
- "I'm afraid that..."
This simple practice helps reconnect us to our emotional reality before God.

## Exercises for Cultivating Receptivity Before Prayer

As we conclude this chapter, here are several Puritan-inspired practices for heart preparation that you can implement immediately:

### 1. The Five-Minute Preparation

Even a brief period of preparation can significantly enhance your prayer experience:
- 1 minute: Silence and setting aside distractions
- 2 minutes: Scripture reading (perhaps a psalm)
- 1 minute: Self-examination
- 1 minute: Contemplating God's character

### 2. Praying for Prayer

The Puritans often "prayed for prayer"—asking God to prepare their hearts and help them pray. Try this simple prayer from the Puritan collection *The Valley of Vision*:

> "Lord, teach me to pray. I confess that the requests of passion and the fears of flesh hinder my praying. Give me a heart and tongue filled with heavenly ingredients."

### 3. Creating Physical Preparation Rituals

Physical actions can support spiritual preparation. Consider:
- Creating a specific prayer space free of distractions
- Lighting a candle to mark the transition to prayer time
- Using a comfortable but alert posture (kneeling was common for Puritans)
- Taking several deep breaths while mentally setting aside concerns

## Conclusion: The Journey Toward Prepared Prayer

Heart preparation isn't about achieving some perfect spiritual state before we're "allowed" to pray. Rather, it's about approaching God mindfully, with appropriate reverence and receptivity. The Puritans remind us that prayer is too significant an activity to engage in casually or thoughtlessly.

As Richard Baxter wisely counseled: "Be sure to come with right ends and intentions: to glorify God, and get the exercise and increase of your grace, and fresh assurance of communion with God." When we prepare our hearts with these aims in mind, prayer becomes not a duty to complete but a relationship to cherish.
