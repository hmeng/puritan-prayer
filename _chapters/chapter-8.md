## The Divinely Inspired Prayer Book

"The Book of Psalms is the liturgy of the soul and the theology of the heart." With these words, the Puritan pastor Thomas Watson (1620-1686) captured a sentiment shared by his fellow Puritans: the Psalms hold a unique and privileged place in Christian prayer. This biblical collection of 150 prayers and songs formed the backbone of Puritan devotional life, serving as both their prayer guide and primary hymnal.

Why did the Puritans value the Psalms so highly? First and foremost, they recognized the Psalms as divinely inspired. These weren't merely human prayers that happened to be preserved; they were God's own Word, teaching us how to pray. As John Calvin, whose thought deeply influenced the Puritans, wrote: "I have been accustomed to call this book not inappropriately, 'The Anatomy of All Parts of the Soul,' for there is not an emotion of which anyone can be conscious that is not here represented as in a mirror."

This chapter explores the Puritan approach to the Psalms as a prayer manual, drawing particularly on the insights of Isaac Watts, who reimagined the Psalms for Christian worship, and Matthew Henry, whose devotional approach to praying the Psalms continues to guide believers today. Their wisdom can help us rediscover this ancient prayer book as a living resource for contemporary spiritual life.

## Isaac Watts on the Psalms and Worship

Isaac Watts (1674-1748), though coming at the end of the Puritan era, represents the culmination of Puritan thought regarding the devotional use of the Psalms. His influential work *The Psalms of David Imitated in the Language of the New Testament* (1719) revolutionized how Christians incorporated the Psalms into their worship and prayer.

### 1. The Psalms as a Comprehensive Prayer Guide

Watts recognized that the Psalms cover the full range of human experience and spiritual need, making them a comprehensive guide to prayer:

> "Here are songs of praise and adoration to the great Creator, Governor, and Savior... Here are confessions of sin, and lamentations over sorrows, with hope in divine mercy... Here are the struglings of a pious soul under deep dejections, the breathings of an heart after God, and the pantings of faith and love towards an unseen Savior."

For Watts, this comprehensive nature made the Psalms uniquely valuable for Christians seeking to develop a balanced prayer life that includes every aspect of authentic spiritual experience.

**Reflection Question**: Which aspects of prayer come most naturally to you (praise, confession, petition, lament, thanksgiving), and which do you tend to neglect? How might the Psalms help you develop a more balanced prayer life?

### 2. The Need for Christological Interpretation

While deeply valuing the Psalms, Watts recognized that Christians needed to read them through a New Testament lens:

> "Where the Psalmist describes religion by the fear of God, I have often joined faith and love to it... Where he speaks of the pardon of sin through the mercies of God, I have added the merits of a Savior... Where something appears too Jewish and cloudy, I have given it a more clear evangelical turn."

Watts believed that Christians should pray the Psalms in light of Christ's coming, seeing in them foreshadowings of Jesus' person and work.

**Christological Exercise**: Select a psalm (perhaps Psalm 23, 51, or 103). As you read it, consider:
- How might this psalm point to Christ?
- How does Jesus fulfill the themes, promises, or longings expressed?
- How would you pray this psalm differently as a Christian than an ancient Israelite might have?

### 3. Watts's Method of Psalm Adaptation

Watts developed a method for adapting psalms for Christian worship and prayer that remains instructive:

> "I have aimed to imitate every Psalm... in the style and manner of the gospel of our blessed Savior, expressing the thoughts as I would have written them if I had been living after the coming of our Lord Jesus."

Watts's approach wasn't about changing the meaning of the Psalms but bringing out their fuller significance in light of Christ's coming.

**Adaptational Practice**: Choose a psalm that seems particularly "pre-Christian" in its perspective (such as Psalm 2, 22, or 110). Following Watts's method, rewrite a portion in your own words, making explicit the connections to Christ that are implicit in the original.

### 4. The Emotional Power of the Psalms

Watts appreciated the Psalms' emotional depth and poetic power:

> "The most frequent tempers and changes of our spirit, and conditions of our life, are here copied, and the breathings of our piety expressed according to the variety of our passions—our love, our fear, our hope, our desire, our sorrow, our wonder, and our joy."

Unlike some who viewed emotion with suspicion, Watts saw the emotional expressiveness of the Psalms as essential to authentic spiritual life.

**Emotional Mapping**: Create a "psalm prescription" list for different emotional states:
- When feeling anxious: Psalm 46, 56, or 121
- When feeling joyful: Psalm 16, 100, or 150
- When feeling guilty: Psalm 32, 51, or 130
- When feeling abandoned: Psalm 13, 22, or 88
- When feeling grateful: Psalm 103, 107, or 116

## Matthew Henry on Devotional Praying of the Psalms

Matthew Henry (1662-1714), renowned for his biblical commentary, offered particularly rich insights on incorporating the Psalms into personal devotion. His approach emphasizes the personal, devotional application of these ancient prayers.

### 1. The Psalms as a Dialogue Between God and the Soul

Henry saw the Psalms as modeling a dynamic dialogue between God and the believer:

> "In the Psalms we have the response of the soul to divine revelation... There God speaks to us, and here we speak to him; there we hear his promises and threatenings, and here we return promises of duty to him and pleas for mercy from him."

This perspective helps us approach the Psalms not merely as texts to be studied but as conversations to be entered.

**Dialogical Reading**: Select a psalm (perhaps Psalm 19, 119, or 139). Read it through once, identifying what God is "saying" through the text. Then read it again as your response to Him, turning statements into personal prayers.

### 2. Finding Ourselves in the Psalms

Henry emphasized seeing our own experiences mirrored in the Psalms:

> "We must in singing the Psalms apply them to ourselves and our own particular circumstances. What we find sung in the person of David, we may and should sing with regard to ourselves, as far as applicable."

Henry believed that the Psalms speak to universal human experiences across time and culture, allowing us to find our own stories within them.

**Personal Application Exercise**: Choose a psalm that seems to connect with your current life situation. Rewrite portions of it in the first person, incorporating specific details from your own experience. For example, "The Lord is my shepherd" might become "Lord, you are my shepherd through this medical diagnosis."

### 3. The Comprehensive Nature of the Psalter

Like Watts, Henry valued the Psalms' comprehensive coverage of spiritual experience:

> "Whatever thy case is, thou mayest, if thou wilt use the Psalms in singing and prayer, find that which is akin to thy case. Art thou in trouble? so was David... Art thou bowed down under the sense of guilt? so was he... Art thou filled with joy in God? so was he."

Henry believed the Psalms provide appropriate words for every spiritual condition, preventing both presumption in good times and despair in difficulties.

**Case Study Analysis**: Identify a significant challenge you're currently facing. Find a psalm that addresses a similar situation (Henry's commentary can help identify these connections). Note how the psalmist:
- Describes the situation
- Expresses emotions honestly
- Appeals to God's character or promises
- Moves toward trust or hope

### 4. Henry's Practical Method for Praying the Psalms

Henry offered practical guidance for incorporating the Psalms into devotional life:

> "It may be of good use to select portions of the Psalms proper for our own case, and to digest them into such a method as may make them most serviceable to us."

He suggested organizing psalms by theme or purpose, creating personal collections for different devotional needs.

**Thematic Collection**: Create your own mini prayer book by selecting and arranging psalms (or portions of psalms) according to themes you frequently need in prayer:
- Psalms of praise for beginning prayer
- Psalms of confession for times of repentance
- Psalms of petition for presenting needs
- Psalms of thanksgiving for cultivating gratitude
- Psalms of trust for confronting fear or anxiety

## How the Puritans Used Different Types of Psalms

The Puritans recognized that the Book of Psalms contains diverse types of prayers, each serving different devotional purposes. Understanding these categories can help us use the Psalms more effectively in prayer.

### 1. Psalms of Praise and Thanksgiving

Psalms primarily focused on declaring God's attributes and works (such as Psalms 8, 19, 104, 145-150) were central to Puritan worship:

> "Praise is the soul breathing towards God... It is the most noble part of the worship of God; and that which shall outlive all other parts of worship." - Thomas Watson

The Puritans used these psalms to cultivate a God-centered perspective that began with who God is rather than with human needs or experiences.

**Praise Practice**: Open your prayer time with one of the following psalms for a week, noticing how beginning with God's character shapes the rest of your prayer:
- Monday: Psalm 8 (God's majesty and care)
- Tuesday: Psalm 19 (God's revelation in creation and Scripture)
- Wednesday: Psalm 33 (God's character and sovereign rule)
- Thursday: Psalm 100 (God's goodness and faithfulness)
- Friday: Psalm 113 (God's transcendence and care for the lowly)
- Saturday: Psalm 145 (God's greatness and compassion)
- Sunday: Psalm 150 (Comprehensive praise)

### 2. Psalms of Lament and Complaint

Contrary to some contemporary approaches that emphasize only positive expressions, the Puritans valued psalms of lament (such as Psalms 13, 22, 42, 88) as essential for honest spiritual formation:

> "God permits his people to make their moan to him in their persecutions and distresses, and directs them to appeal to his righteous judgment against their unrighteous persecutors." - Matthew Henry

The Puritans saw these psalms as providing both permission and language for bringing our darkest experiences before God.

**Guided Lament**: If you're facing a difficult situation, use this simplified structure adapted from the lament psalms:
1. Direct address to God ("O LORD...")
2. Honest description of your situation and feelings
3. Request for God's intervention
4. Expression of trust despite circumstances
5. Commitment to praise God regardless of outcome

### 3. Psalms of Confession and Penitence

The Puritans, with their deep sense of sin's seriousness, particularly valued penitential psalms (such as Psalms 32, 38, 51, 130) for personal and corporate confession:

> "True confession of sin is always particular; not only, I have sinned, but, I have sinned thus and thus." - John Owen

These psalms provided patterns for thorough and sincere confession that avoided both minimizing sin and wallowing in guilt.

**Confession Framework**: Use Psalm 51 as a guide for comprehensive confession:
1. Appeal to God's mercy (vv. 1-2)
2. Acknowledge specific sins without excuse (vv. 3-4)
3. Recognize deeper sinful patterns (vv. 5-6)
4. Request cleansing and renewal (vv. 7-12)
5. Commit to changed behavior (vv. 13-17)

### 4. Psalms of Instruction and Wisdom

The Puritans also valued didactic psalms (such as Psalms 1, 15, 119) that teach principles for godly living:

> "In singing these psalms of instruction we must teach and admonish one another in the knowledge and fear of God." - Matthew Henry

These psalms provided material for meditation and self-examination regarding one's spiritual condition and moral choices.

**Wisdom Meditation**: Select a portion of Psalm 119 (perhaps one 8-verse section). Read it slowly, considering:
- What does this teach about God's Word?
- How have I experienced the reality described?
- Where do I fall short of this ideal?
- What specific application can I make today?

Turn these reflections into prayer, asking God for greater love for and obedience to His Word.

## Creating a Personal Prayer Book Inspired by the Psalms

The Puritans often created personal collections of prayers and psalms adapted for their own use. This practice of creating a personalized prayer book remains valuable today.

### 1. Selecting Foundational Psalms

Begin by identifying 5-10 psalms that particularly resonate with your spiritual journey and current life situation:

**Selection Prompts**:
- Which psalms have been meaningful during significant moments in your life?
- Which speak to your current challenges or questions?
- Which express aspects of God's character especially meaningful to you?
- Which give voice to emotions you frequently experience?

**Personalization Step**: For each selected psalm, write a brief note about why it's significant to you and how you might use it in prayer.

### 2. Creating Adapted Versions

Following Watts's example, consider creating your own adapted versions of key psalms:

**Adaptation Methods**:
- Update archaic language for easier praying
- Insert specific people or situations relevant to your life
- Make Christological connections explicit
- Emphasize aspects particularly meaningful to you

**Example Adaptation**: Psalm 23 personalized:
"Lord, you are my shepherd in this season of career uncertainty; I lack nothing essential. You provide rest for my anxious mind and lead me to refreshment when I'm depleted. You restore my perspective when I lose sight of what matters. You guide me toward wise decisions that honor you. Even when I walk through this dark valley of financial pressure, I will fear no evil because you are with me..."

### 3. Organizing by Prayer Needs

Arrange your selected psalms according to recurring prayer needs in your life:

**Organizational Categories**:
- Beginning the day with God
- Finding strength in difficulty
- Seeking guidance for decisions
- Confessing sin and receiving forgiveness
- Expressing gratitude
- Interceding for others
- Ending the day with God

**Practical Implementation**: Create either a physical prayer journal with these categories or digital folders containing your selected psalms for each purpose.

### 4. Incorporating with Other Prayer Elements

The Puritans often combined psalms with other devotional elements:

**Integrated Prayer Practice**:
1. Begin with a psalm of praise or invocation
2. Add personal prayers of thanksgiving for recent blessings
3. Include a psalm of confession followed by specific confession
4. Incorporate Scripture reading and reflection
5. Present specific petitions for yourself and others
6. Conclude with a psalm of trust or commitment

**Weekly Template**: Create a weekly prayer template that incorporates different psalms each day, ensuring you engage with various types of psalms regularly.

## Practice in Praying Through a Psalm

As we conclude, here's a guided practice for praying through a psalm—a method commonly used by the Puritans and still valuable today:

### Guided Prayer through Psalm 27

This exercise walks through praying Psalm 27, a rich psalm that combines confidence, petition, and commitment. Adapt the approach for other psalms as desired.

#### 1. Read and Reflect (verses 1-3)

Begin by reading slowly: "The LORD is my light and my salvation—whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life—of whom shall I be afraid?..."

**Personalize**: "Lord, you are my light when I face confusion about [specific situation]. You are my salvation from [specific threat or problem]. You are the stronghold that protects me when [specific person or circumstance] makes me feel vulnerable..."

#### 2. Express Desire (verses 4-6)

Continue reading: "One thing I ask from the LORD, this only do I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life..."

**Personalize**: "Lord, amid all my competing desires and distractions, help me focus on what matters most—knowing and experiencing you. When I'm tempted to find security in [specific false security], remind me that true safety is found only in your presence..."

#### 3. Make Specific Requests (verses 7-12)

Continue: "Hear my voice when I call, LORD; be merciful to me and answer me..."

**Personalize**: "Lord, I specifically ask for your help with [detailed situation]. Show me your way forward when [specific people] give conflicting advice. Protect me from [specific threat or temptation]. Give me patience when [specific challenge] tests my endurance..."

#### 4. Choose Trust and Commitment (verses 13-14)

Conclude: "I remain confident of this: I will see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living. Wait for the LORD; be strong and take heart and wait for the LORD."

**Personalize**: "Lord, despite what I see and feel in this situation with [specific challenge], I choose to believe I will experience your goodness here and now, not just in eternity. Help me wait for your timing regarding [specific outcome I desire]. Strengthen my heart when waiting becomes difficult..."

## Conclusion: The Timeless Prayer Book

The Puritans recognized what many Christians throughout history have discovered: the Psalms provide an inspired vocabulary for prayer that transcends time, culture, and circumstance. When our own words fail, the Psalms give voice to our deepest needs, longings, fears, and joys.

As Isaac Watts wrote: "The Psalms are the most noble part of prayer, and the most elevated compositions of praise, that ever the Holy Ghost himself inspired here on earth; and will be made use of in our devotions to all eternity."

By incorporating the Psalms into our prayer lives—whether through reading, singing, adaptation, or memorization—we join a great communion of believers stretching across time who have found in these ancient prayers a living voice for their own conversations with God.

May these Puritan insights help you rediscover the Psalms not as distant religious poetry but as a vibrant, God-given language for your own prayers—a prayer manual for all seasons of the soul.
