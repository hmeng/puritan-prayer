## The Universal Experience of Prayer Challenges

Have you ever sat down to pray only to find your mind wandering to your to-do list? Or perhaps you've experienced seasons when prayer feels dry and God seems distant? Maybe you've struggled with doubts about whether prayer truly makes a difference? If so, you're in good company. Even the most devoted believers throughout history—including the Puritans—faced these same challenges.

The Puritans were remarkably honest about the difficulties of prayer. Rather than portraying an idealized spiritual life, they candidly discussed their struggles and offered practical wisdom for overcoming them. This chapter explores their insights on three common barriers to prayer: spiritual dryness, distraction, and doubt.

## John Owen's Diagnosis of Spiritual Dryness

John Owen (1616-1683), often called "the prince of the Puritans" for his theological depth, wrote extensively about the problem of spiritual dryness—those seasons when our hearts feel cold and prayer becomes a struggle.

### 1. Recognizing the Reality of Spiritual Seasons

Owen recognized that even mature believers experience times of spiritual dullness. In his work *Communion with God*, he wrote:

> "The frame of the heart is not always alike in actual communion with God. There are times of spiritual desertion, when God in his wisdom withdraws the sense of his presence... that we might know we have all by free grace and gift."

This perspective offers both reality and hope: spiritual dryness is normal, not a sign of abandonment. God may use these seasons to deepen our dependence and appreciation of His grace.

**Reflection Question**: How do you typically respond to periods of spiritual dryness? Do you abandon prayer, redouble your efforts, or question your faith? How might Owen's perspective change your response?

### 2. Understanding the Causes of Spiritual Dryness

Owen identified several potential causes for seasons of dryness in prayer:

#### Secret Sin

> "Secret sins lying in the heart unrepented of and unmortified will make it withered in the spiritual things, so that it shall have very little delight in them."

Owen believed unconfessed sin creates distance in our relationship with God, much as unresolved issues create tension in human relationships.

#### Worldly Distractions

> "When the soul is filled and taken up with other things, it tends to weakening of all graces, especially that of faith... The world with the things thereof, possess the mind with endless distractions, so that it does not attend to the things of God."

Owen recognized that overconsumption of worldly concerns can crowd out spiritual affections—a challenge even more relevant in our age of information overload.

#### Spiritual Pride

> "Pride, sloth, negligence, or formality in our duty will cause this spiritual malady, but there is a better remedy than to be always bewailing it."

Owen observed that sometimes our prayers grow dry because we've become mechanical or proud in our approach, forgetting our dependence on God.

**Self-Examination Exercise**: Which of these potential causes resonates with your experience of spiritual dryness? Take time to honestly assess whether sin, worldly distractions, or spiritual pride might be contributing to your struggles in prayer.

### 3. Owen's Remedies for Spiritual Dryness

Owen didn't merely diagnose the problem but offered practical solutions:

#### Honest Confession

> "If thou findest thyself lifeless in prayer, confess it to God; humbled yourself for it. This is the ready way to cure that soul-disease."

Rather than abandoning prayer when it feels dry, Owen advised making the very dryness itself a matter of honest conversation with God.

**Practical Application**: The next time prayer feels dry, try this simple prayer: "Lord, my heart feels cold toward you right now. I confess this dullness and ask you to rekindle my affections. Even in this dryness, I choose to seek you."

#### Meditation on Christ

> "Set faith at work on Christ for the healing of this distemper, by a fresh application to the cross, a new act of sight to the blood of Christ, washing away this dullness and deadness of the soul."

Owen believed that reconnecting with the central realities of the gospel—Christ's love and sacrifice—could reawaken spiritual affections.

**Guided Meditation**: Spend 10 minutes reflecting on a Gospel account of Christ's sacrifice (such as Luke 23:33-46). Ask the Holy Spirit to help you see Christ's love afresh and to respond with gratitude and renewed affection.

#### Perseverance Through Dryness

> "Abide in the duty, though thou findest not that sweetness in it which thou desirest... Sometimes great discouragements arise, but faith helps to make good our ground."

Perhaps Owen's most practical advice was simply to continue praying through seasons of dryness, trusting that faithfulness itself is spiritual progress.

**Group Discussion Question**: Have you experienced breakthroughs after persevering through a dry season in prayer? What helped you maintain consistency when you didn't feel like praying?

## William Gurnall's Strategies for Battling Distraction

William Gurnall (1616-1679), author of the monumental work *The Christian in Complete Armour*, understood the challenge of distraction in prayer. His military metaphors offer practical strategies for maintaining focus.

### 1. Understanding the Nature of Distraction

Gurnall recognized that distraction in prayer isn't merely a concentration problem but a spiritual battle:

> "Satan knows that spoiling your prayer is half a victory. It may be you have sometimes gone so encumbered in duty, that you have thought you should never venture again into the presence of God, but give up your weapons, and throw away prayer forever."

This perspective helps us see distraction not as a personal failing but as an expected spiritual challenge that requires intentional response.

**Reflection Exercise**: What are your most common distractions during prayer? Make a brief list, noting whether they tend to be external interruptions, internal worries, or wandering thoughts.

### 2. Practical Strategies for Maintaining Focus

Gurnall offered several practical approaches to battle distraction:

#### Preparation Before Prayer

> "Go not to prayer as the horse rushes into the battle, without consideration or preparation... Thou shouldst take some time to withdraw thyself from worldly affairs, that thou mayest be more free for communion with God."

This advice anticipates modern research on attention, which confirms that transitional time between activities improves focus.

**Practical Application**: Before prayer, try a brief "transition ritual" such as:
- Taking three deep breaths
- Reading a short Scripture passage
- Sitting in silence for 60 seconds
- Writing down distracting thoughts to address later

#### Active Engagement During Prayer

> "Keep thy heart with all diligence; even in prayer, watch that thy heart wanders not. Thou canst not be too circumspect, for thou hast a subtle enemy that will steal thy heart away from the duty, even while the duty is being performed."

Gurnall recognized that passive prayer invites distraction. Active engagement—through visualization, journaling, or physical posture—can help maintain focus.

**Focus Technique**: If you find your mind wandering during prayer, try praying out loud in a whisper, writing your prayers in a journal, or walking while you pray. Physical engagement often helps mental attention.

#### Immediate Recovery from Distraction

> "When thou findest thy thoughts disordered, do not give up thy work, but recover them. A musician will not throw away his instrument when he finds it out of tune, but will wind up the strings and fall to his work again."

Rather than seeing distraction as failure, Gurnall advised treating it as a normal part of prayer that requires gentle redirection.

**Mindful Practice**: When you notice your mind has wandered during prayer, avoid self-criticism. Instead, simply acknowledge the distraction, then gently return to prayer using a transition phrase like "Back to you, Lord" or "Where was I?"

### 3. Dealing with Persistent Distractions

For those particularly difficult distractions that continually intrude on prayer, Gurnall offered specialized advice:

#### Addressing Troubling Thoughts Directly

> "Sometimes it will be necessary to turn thy prayer against thy distractions, beseeching God to rid thee of those impertinent thoughts which interrupt thee."

Rather than trying to ignore persistent distractions, Gurnall suggested making them the subject of prayer themselves.

**Prayer Exercise**: If a particular worry keeps intruding on your prayers, try explicitly praying about that concern: "Lord, I keep thinking about this meeting tomorrow. I give this worry to you now. Help me trust you with it and return my attention to our conversation."

#### Accountability for Attention

> "Remember, God's eye is on thee in prayer, and thou art to pray to thy Father who seeth in secret. This would make thee pray with respect to the duty itself, rather than to the esteem of men."

Gurnall believed that cultivating awareness of God's presence during prayer naturally reduces distraction.

**Awareness Practice**: Begin your prayer time by spending 30 seconds simply acknowledging God's presence. Imagine Him before you, attentive to your words. Notice how this awareness affects your focus throughout the prayer.

## Thomas Brooks on Overcoming Doubts in Prayer

Thomas Brooks (1608-1680), known for his pastoral sensitivity, addressed the doubts that can plague believers during prayer—doubts about God's willingness to hear, prayer's effectiveness, or one's own worthiness to approach God.

### 1. The Common Experience of Doubt

Brooks normalized the experience of doubt, acknowledging it as a common struggle rather than a shameful secret:

> "Christians are never beyond doubting hours till they are beyond the reach of Satan's temptations... A Christian's doubts are no part of his sins, though they arise from sin and do cause sin."

This compassionate perspective helps us face our doubts honestly rather than suppressing them.

**Reflection Question**: What specific doubts most commonly affect your prayer life? Do you doubt God's willingness to hear, your worthiness to approach Him, or the efficacy of prayer itself?

### 2. Distinguishing Types of Doubt

Brooks helpfully distinguished between different kinds of doubt that might affect our prayers:

#### Intellectual Doubt

> "There is a doubting of the head, which ariseth from want of light and information... this may consist with a great deal of uprightness and a great deal of endeavor after the things of God."

These are questions about how prayer works, why some prayers seem unanswered, or how divine sovereignty relates to human requests.

#### Emotional Doubt

> "There is a doubting of the heart, which ariseth from the strength of corruption... These doubtings are those usual attendants that do accompany the hours of temptation."

These are the felt uncertainties that arise during prayer—feelings of God's absence or questions about whether He truly cares.

**Self-Assessment**: Which type of doubt most affects your prayer life—intellectual questions or emotional uncertainties? Understanding the nature of your doubts can help you address them appropriately.

### 3. Brooks' Remedies for Doubt in Prayer

Brooks offered practical counsel for addressing both types of doubt:

#### For Intellectual Doubts: Anchor in Scripture

> "Doubt thou not as to any good that the Scripture plainly promiseth to thee. It were unbelief, not doubting, to question the performance of God's word."

Brooks directed doubters to Scripture's promises about prayer, particularly Jesus' teachings on the Father's willingness to hear (Matthew 7:7-11) and the Spirit's help in prayer (Romans 8:26).

**Scripture Exercise**: Create a small collection of verses about prayer that address your specific doubts. Write them on cards to review before prayer times, or even incorporate them into your prayers: "Lord, you promise in your Word that..."

#### For Emotional Doubts: Remember Past Faithfulness

> "Call to mind former experiences of God's goodness and mercy towards thee... Hath not God heard thee in former times, and shall he not hear thee again? Hast thou not formerly found the Lord to be a God pardoning and healing, and shall he not be so still?"

Brooks believed that recalling specific instances of God's faithfulness could counteract present doubts.

**Journaling Practice**: Start a "prayer testimony" journal where you record specific answers to prayer. During times of doubt, review this record of God's faithfulness in your own experience.

#### For All Doubts: Continue Praying

> "Though thou canst not pray with such confidence, such cheerfulness, such sweetness, such warmth, as formerly... yet do not give over the work. When you can do nothing else, you can do this—complain you cannot pray."

Like Owen and Gurnall, Brooks advised perseverance through doubt rather than abandoning prayer until doubts are resolved.

**Practice in Persistence**: When doubt makes prayer difficult, try using simple, honest expressions like:
- "Lord, I'm struggling to believe you hear me, but I'm still coming to you."
- "I don't know if this makes a difference, but I choose to pray anyway."
- "Help my unbelief even as I bring this request to you."

## Modern Barriers to Prayer and Puritan Solutions

While the Puritans identified timeless challenges to prayer, our contemporary context presents unique obstacles they couldn't have anticipated. Yet their wisdom can be adapted to address even these modern barriers.

### 1. Digital Distraction and Information Overload

Our smartphone-saturated culture creates unprecedented challenges for focused attention. Studies show the average person checks their phone 96 times daily—about once every 10 minutes during waking hours.

**Puritan-Inspired Solution**: William Gurnall's advice about preparation would suggest creating digital boundaries around prayer time—perhaps a "phone sabbath" where devices are turned off or placed in another room during designated prayer periods.

**Practical Implementation**: Try using a physical Bible and journal for prayer rather than digital versions. Consider apps that block other applications during set times, or use airplane mode during prayer sessions.

### 2. Busyness and Hurry Sickness

Our culture often values productivity over presence, leading to what sociologists call "hurry sickness"—a continuous sense of time pressure that makes sustained prayer seem impractical.

**Puritan-Inspired Solution**: Richard Baxter's advice on prayer rhythms offers a balanced approach—combining regular set times with brief moments throughout the day. The Puritans would challenge our assumption that we're "too busy to pray" while affirming flexible approaches to prayer.

**Schedule Strategy**: Block 10-15 minutes for prayer in your calendar as a non-negotiable appointment. Then identify 3-5 natural transition points in your day (morning coffee, commute, lunch break) for brief, 60-second prayer moments.

### 3. Therapeutic Self-Sufficiency

Modern therapeutic culture often emphasizes self-help solutions that can make prayer seem unnecessary or ineffective compared to psychological techniques.

**Puritan-Inspired Solution**: John Owen's emphasis on human limitation and divine necessity offers a corrective perspective. The Puritans would affirm the value of mental health resources while maintaining that prayer addresses fundamental human needs that no technique can satisfy.

**Integrated Approach**: Consider how prayer might complement rather than compete with other well-being practices. For example, a mindfulness exercise might transition into contemplative prayer, or a therapy insight might become the subject of thanksgiving or petition.

## Practical Techniques for Maintaining Focus in Prayer

As we conclude, here are several practical techniques that apply Puritan insights to our modern context:

### 1. The Prayer Walk

Movement can help maintain focus during prayer, particularly for those who struggle with sitting still:
- Choose a quiet route (neighborhood, park, or even around your yard)
- Begin with a brief Scripture or prayer to focus your mind
- Associate different prayer topics with different segments of your walk
- Use visual triggers in your environment as prayer prompts

### 2. The Prayer Journal

Writing can externalize our thoughts and reduce mental wandering:
- Use a dedicated journal for prayer
- Create sections for different types of prayer (praise, confession, thanksgiving, petition)
- Write your prayers as if writing a letter to God
- Review previous entries to track God's faithfulness and answered prayers

### 3. The Prayer Partner

Accountability and community can strengthen prayer in times of dryness or doubt:
- Meet regularly (in person or virtually) with a trusted friend
- Share prayer requests and follow up on previous ones
- Pray together during your meeting
- Check in briefly between meetings for encouragement and reminders

## Conclusion: From Barriers to Breakthroughs

The barriers we've explored in this chapter—spiritual dryness, distraction, and doubt—are not signs of spiritual failure but normal challenges in the life of prayer. The Puritans, with their unflinching honesty and practical wisdom, show us that these very obstacles can become opportunities for growth.

In the words of Thomas Brooks, "The hardest duties bring the sweetest rewards." When we persist in prayer despite dryness, redirect our wandering minds, and honestly bring our doubts to God, we often discover a deeper, more resilient faith on the other side of these struggles.

Perhaps the most encouraging Puritan insight is that prayer itself is the solution to prayer's difficulties. As we continue to show up—even with cold hearts, distracted minds, and questioning souls—we position ourselves to receive what only God can give: renewed passion, focused attention, and strengthened faith.
