## The Runner's Obstacles

Madison had trained for months for her first marathon. She'd logged hundreds of miles, adjusted her diet, and studied race strategy. Yet on race day, unexpected barriers arose—a sudden downpour, a painful blister at mile fifteen, and the dreaded "wall" at mile twenty where her energy seemed to evaporate.

What separated the finishers from those who dropped out wasn't superior training but how they responded to these inevitable obstacles. Madison later reflected, "I finished not because I avoided barriers but because I'd learned strategies to overcome them."

This runner's experience parallels our journey in prayer. No matter how sincere our intentions or how solid our understanding of prayer's importance, we will inevitably face barriers. The Puritans, with their characteristic blend of spiritual insight and practical wisdom, offer invaluable guidance for identifying and overcoming these common obstacles to meaningful prayer.

## John Owen: Diagnosing and Addressing Spiritual Dryness

John Owen (1616-1683), often regarded as the greatest Puritan theologian, wrote extensively about the problem of spiritual dryness—those seasons when our hearts feel cold, prayer seems mechanical, and God feels distant.

### Understanding the Nature of Spiritual Dryness

In his profound work *Communion with God*, Owen distinguished between temporary spiritual dullness (which all believers experience) and a more concerning pattern of spiritual decline:

> "There is a difference between the decay of grace and the decay of the sense of grace. The former is what we must always prevent; the latter what we must always expect."

Owen identified several key characteristics of spiritual dryness:

1. **Diminished affection for God** – A cooling of former love and delight
2. **Increased love for the world** – Growing attachment to temporal comforts
3. **Neglect of spiritual disciplines** – Prayer becoming a burden rather than a delight
4. **Tolerance of known sin** – Making peace with what formerly troubled the conscience
5. **Reduced spiritual appetite** – Less hunger for God's Word and presence

**Self-Examination**: Which of these symptoms of spiritual dryness do you recognize in your own prayer life? How have they affected your approach to prayer?

### Owen's Diagnosis of the Causes

Owen identified several common causes of spiritual dryness in prayer:

#### 1. Unconfessed Sin

> "Sin is not only a web, but also a root; not only a scar, but a disease; not only a tyranny, but a nature. Sin untreated will choke prayer as surely as weeds choke a garden."

Owen observed that unresolved sin creates a barrier between us and God, making prayer increasingly difficult. He taught that:
- Sin dulls our spiritual senses
- It creates a reluctance to enter God's presence
- It diminishes our confidence in approaching God

**Practical Response**: Owen recommended regular self-examination and confession. He wrote, "Keep short accounts with God. Do not let guilt accumulate like unpaid debts."

#### 2. Doctrinal Neglect

Owen, himself a theological giant, recognized that robust doctrine fuels vibrant prayer:

> "When the mind is not stored with the truths of God, the heart will be empty of the grace of God."

He believed that:
- Sound doctrine provides the content for meaningful prayer
- A weak grasp of God's nature leads to anemic prayer
- Proper understanding of gospel truths kindles affection in prayer

**Practical Response**: Owen suggested intentionally connecting doctrine to devotion by meditating on theological truths until they warm the heart.

#### 3. Neglect of Communion with the Trinity

Perhaps Owen's most distinctive insight was how spiritual dryness stems from neglecting relationship with the triune God:

> "Our communion with God is with the Father, in love and grace; with the Son, in grace and truth; with the Holy Spirit, in sanctification and consolation."

Owen taught that vibrant prayer involves:
- Communing distinctly with each person of the Trinity
- Appreciating the unique role of each in our salvation
- Drawing on the particular comfort each provides

**Prayer Exercise**: In your next prayer time, deliberately address each person of the Trinity, acknowledging their unique role in your life and salvation. Thank the Father for His love and election, the Son for His redemption and intercession, and the Spirit for His presence and sanctification.

### Owen's Remedies for Spiritual Dryness

Owen offered several practical strategies for overcoming seasons of spiritual dryness:

#### 1. Remember Christ's Intercession

> "When you cannot pray, remember there is One who ever lives to make intercession for you. Your Advocate before the throne never suffers from spiritual dryness."

Owen recommended:
- Taking comfort in Christ's perfect prayer on our behalf
- Looking to Jesus as our prayer representative
- Allowing this truth to relieve performance pressure in prayer

**Reflection Prompt**: How might your prayer experience change if you began with a reminder of Christ's ongoing intercession for you?

#### 2. Meditate on God's Faithfulness

> "Call to mind what He has done, that you may know what to expect; remember His kindness in the past, that you may know how to trust Him for the future."

Owen suggested:
- Keeping a record of God's past faithfulness
- Reviewing it during times of spiritual dryness
- Using these memories to rekindle spiritual affection

**Practical Step**: Create a "faithfulness journal" where you record specific instances of God's work in your life. Review it when prayer feels dry or difficult.

#### 3. Seek the Spirit's Help

Owen emphasized the Spirit's essential role in overcoming prayerlessness:

> "The Spirit helps us in our weakness, for we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words."

He taught that:
- The Spirit is given specifically to aid our prayers
- We can explicitly ask for His assistance
- Even our groans become meaningful prayers through His help

**Prayer Prompt**: Begin your prayer time with this simple request: "Holy Spirit, I acknowledge my weakness in prayer. Help me to pray as I ought."

## William Gurnall: Strategies for Battling Distractions

William Gurnall (1616-1679), author of the massive *The Christian in Complete Armour*, provided exceptional insight into the problem of distraction in prayer. His military metaphors offer practical strategies for maintaining focus.

### Understanding the Battle for Attention

Gurnall recognized that distraction in prayer is not merely a concentration problem but a spiritual battle:

> "Satan knows that if he can spoil your praying, he has spoiled your power. Therefore what he cannot prevent, he will be sure to disturb."

He identified three primary sources of distraction:

1. **External distractions** – Environmental interruptions and stimuli
2. **Internal wanderings** – The mind's natural tendency to drift
3. **Spiritual opposition** – Direct interference from spiritual forces

**Group Discussion Question**: Which type of distraction most frequently disrupts your prayers? What patterns have you noticed about when and how distractions arise?

### Gurnall's Battle Plan for Focused Prayer

Using military imagery, Gurnall offered several strategies for combating distractions:

#### 1. Establish a Secure Perimeter

> "Choose, if possible, a place free from concourse and flow of people. Our Lord calls it entering into your closet and shutting your door—implying both secrecy and seclusion."

Gurnall recommended:
- Creating a dedicated prayer space when possible
- Removing obvious distractions before beginning
- Signaling to others your need for uninterrupted time

**Practical Application**: What simple changes could you make to your physical environment to reduce distractions during prayer? Consider factors like noise, visual distractions, and potential interruptions.

#### 2. Prepare for Battle

> "He who would pray with a collected mind must first collect his mind before he prays... A musician first tunes his instrument before he plays."

Gurnall suggested:
- Taking time to quiet your thoughts before prayer
- Writing down distracting concerns to address later
- Performing a brief "mind clearing" exercise

**Practical Exercise**: Before your next prayer time, take two minutes to write down any pressing concerns, tasks, or ideas that might distract you. This "brain dump" acknowledges these thoughts while setting them aside for later.

#### 3. Deploy Strategic Reinforcements

> "When your heart is flying abroad, get it home as soon as you can. Throw this water on the fire of your affection. Shame yourself for your wandering... Say, 'Is God's presence no more worth than this?'"

For recapturing wandering attention, Gurnall advised:
- Immediately acknowledging when your mind has wandered
- Gently but firmly redirecting your thoughts to prayer
- Using written or spoken prayers to anchor your attention

**Practical Tip**: Keep a small card with key prayer points nearby. When your mind wanders, glance at it to reorient your prayers.

#### 4. Maintain the Offensive Position

> "It is easier never to let an enemy in than to get him out once he enters... Therefore set a strong guard at first."

Gurnall's preventative approach included:
- Praying aloud to maintain focus
- Using physical postures that promote alertness
- Breaking prayer into shorter, more focused sessions

**Self-Examination**: What time of day are you most mentally alert? Could you schedule your most important prayer times during these peak periods?

## Thomas Brooks: Overcoming Doubt and Discouragement

Thomas Brooks (1608-1680), best known for *Precious Remedies Against Satan's Devices*, offers valuable guidance for dealing with doubts, discouragement, and uncertainty in prayer.

### Understanding the Nature of Doubt in Prayer

Brooks recognized several forms of doubt that afflict believers in prayer:

> "Sometimes Christians are troubled with temptations of atheism—questioning whether there is a God who hears prayer. Sometimes with temptations of unbelief—doubting their personal interest in this God. And sometimes with temptations of present unworthiness—thinking themselves too sinful to approach this God."

He identified common manifestations of doubt in prayer:

1. **Theological doubt** – Questions about whether God truly hears or answers
2. **Personal doubt** – Uncertainty about one's standing before God
3. **Circumstantial doubt** – Confusion caused by unanswered prayers
4. **Comparative doubt** – Feeling inadequate compared to others' prayer lives

**Reflection Question**: Which type of doubt most frequently affects your prayer life? How has this doubt influenced both the frequency and content of your prayers?

### Brooks' Remedies for Doubt in Prayer

Brooks offered several practical strategies for overcoming doubts and discouragements in prayer:

#### 1. Stand on God's Promises, Not Feelings

> "A believer's comfort should not wholly depend upon his experience, but rather upon the truth and certainty of God's promises. The promise is the ground of faith, and faith is the ground of comfort."

Brooks taught that:
- God's reliability doesn't depend on our feelings
- His promises remain true even when we don't perceive their effects
- Scripture provides firm ground when our emotions fluctuate

**Practical Application**: Identify and memorize 2-3 of God's promises specifically related to prayer (such as Matthew 7:7-8, John 14:13-14, or 1 John 5:14-15). Review these promises when doubt arises.

#### 2. Remember God's Character, Not Just His Acts

> "What God has been, He still is, and ever will be. Though He may change His dispensations, yet He never changes His disposition."

Brooks encouraged believers to:
- Focus on God's unchanging nature
- Trust His character when confused by His actions
- Remember His core attributes of love, wisdom, and faithfulness

**Prayer Exercise**: Spend 5 minutes in prayer focusing exclusively on who God is, not what He does. Praise Him for His unchanging attributes regardless of your circumstances.

#### 3. Distinguish Between Perfect Prayer and Accepted Prayer

Brooks offered this comforting perspective:

> "It is not the arithmetic of our prayers, how many they are; nor the rhetoric of our prayers, how eloquent they are; nor the geometry of our prayers, how long they are; nor the music of our prayers, how sweet our voice may be; nor the method of our prayers, how orderly they may be; nor even the divinity of our prayers, how good the doctrine may be, which God looks at. It is the sincerity of our prayers that is the Spiritworking in them which makes them accepted."

He taught that:
- God accepts imperfect prayers offered in faith
- The Spirit transforms our weak prayers into effective ones
- The standard is not perfection but sincerity

**Journaling Prompt**: Write about a time when God answered a prayer that felt inadequate or imperfect to you. What does this reveal about His character and how He views your prayers?

#### 4. Recognize Doubt as a Universal Experience

Brooks normalized doubt as part of the believer's journey:

> "There is no saint recorded in Scripture who has not sometimes been under the power of doubts and fears. It is not therefore the presence of doubts, but the submitting to them that evidences an unsound heart."

He encouraged:
- Learning from biblical examples of doubt and faith
- Not allowing doubts to completely derail prayer
- Continuing to pray even while expressing doubts honestly

**Group Discussion**: Read the story in Mark 9:14-29 of the father who cried, "I believe; help my unbelief!" Discuss how this example might guide our approach to prayer during times of doubt.

## Modern Barriers to Prayer and Puritan Solutions

While the Puritans wrote centuries ago, their wisdom remarkably addresses challenges we face today:

### Barrier 1: The Distraction of Technology

Our digital devices create unprecedented opportunities for distraction.

**Puritan-Inspired Solution**: William Gurnall's advice to "establish a secure perimeter" applies perfectly to our need for digital boundaries. Consider:
- Putting devices in "Do Not Disturb" mode during prayer
- Creating tech-free zones or times in your home
- Using apps that block distractions during designated prayer periods

**Practical Step**: Try a "digital sunset" practice—disconnecting from devices at least 30 minutes before bedtime prayer to allow your mind to settle.

### Barrier 2: The Pace of Modern Life

Our hurried lifestyles leave little margin for unhurried prayer.

**Puritan-Inspired Solution**: Richard Baxter (as discussed in the previous chapter) emphasized "stated times" for prayer. In our context:
- Schedule prayer appointments in your calendar with the same priority as other meetings
- Create transition rituals to help shift from activity to prayer
- Practice "prayer interludes"—brief moments of connection throughout the day

**Practical Step**: Identify three potential 5-minute windows in your daily schedule that could become regular prayer interludes.

### Barrier 3: The Pressure of Performance

Our achievement-oriented culture can turn prayer into another task to perfect.

**Puritan-Inspired Solution**: Thomas Brooks' distinction between perfect and accepted prayer offers relief:
- Embrace prayer as relationship, not performance
- Focus on sincerity rather than technique
- Remember that grace applies to how we pray, not just what we pray about

**Reflection Question**: How has the performance mindset affected your approach to prayer? What would change if you viewed prayer primarily as communion rather than achievement?

## Practical Techniques for Overcoming Prayer Barriers

Drawing from Puritan wisdom, here are practical techniques to address common prayer obstacles:

### For Spiritual Dryness (Owen):

#### The Scriptural Immersion Technique

**Method**:
1. Select a passage that portrays God's character vividly (try Psalm 145 or Isaiah 40)
2. Read slowly, aloud if possible
3. Pause after each verse to consider what it reveals about God
4. Turn each insight into a simple expression of praise
5. Allow this to kindle affection before moving to petition

**Time Required**: 7-10 minutes

#### The Spiritual Temperature Check

**Method**:
1. Mentally review your spiritual state using Owen's five indicators of dryness
2. For each area of coolness, acknowledge the condition honestly to God
3. Request specific help for each identified area
4. Remember Christ's perfect intercession on your behalf
5. Express gratitude for God's patience and restorative grace

**Time Required**: 5-7 minutes

### For Distraction (Gurnall):

#### The Anchor Prayer Technique

**Method**:
1. Choose a simple phrase or Scripture verse as an "anchor"
2. Begin prayer with this phrase
3. When distractions come, acknowledge them without judgment
4. Gently return to your anchor phrase
5. Repeat as needed throughout your prayer time

**Time Required**: Variable - can be used for brief or extended prayer

#### The Written Focus Method

**Method**:
1. Write out key prayer points before beginning
2. Pray with eyes open, following your written guide
3. Make brief notes when important thoughts arise
4. Add checkmarks next to items as you pray about them
5. Keep the written prayer for future reference

**Time Required**: 10-15 minutes

### For Doubt and Discouragement (Brooks):

#### The Truth Declaration Practice

**Method**:
1. Identify specific doubts affecting your prayers
2. For each doubt, find a corresponding truth in Scripture
3. Write these truths on cards or in a prayer journal
4. Begin prayer by declaring these truths aloud
5. Refer back to them when doubt resurfaces during prayer

**Time Required**: 5 minutes preparation, then ongoing use

#### The Doubt-to-Dialogue Conversion

**Method**:
1. Express your doubts to God directly and specifically
2. Turn each doubt into a question: "Lord, I struggle to believe you hear me. Do you really listen when I pray?"
3. Wait in silence for 1-2 minutes after each question
4. Note any Scripture, insights, or impressions that arise
5. End by thanking God for His patience with your questions

**Time Required**: 10-15 minutes

## Reflection Questions

1. Which of the barriers discussed in this chapter most frequently hinders your prayer life, and why do you think it has such power?

2. How might John Owen's distinction between "the decay of grace and the decay of the sense of grace" bring comfort during times of spiritual dryness?

3. Which of William Gurnall's strategies for battling distraction seems most promising for your situation? What specific steps could you take to implement it?

4. In what ways have you allowed doubt to stop your prayers altogether rather than making doubt itself a subject of prayer?

5. How might honestly acknowledging prayer barriers actually deepen rather than diminish your relationship with God?

## A Prayer for Overcoming Barriers

> 
> I come to You acknowledging the barriers
> that too often stand between us:
> the dryness that leaves me wordless,
> the distractions that pull me away,
> the doubts that whisper I'm not heard.
> 
> Thank You that You receive imperfect prayers,
> that Your Spirit interprets my groans,
> that Your Son intercedes when I cannot.
> 
> When my heart grows cold, warm it with Your truth.
> When my mind wanders, gently call it back.
> When doubts arise, remind me of Your faithfulness.
> 
> I need not overcome these barriers through my strength,

> not with perfect prayers, but with a sincere heart.
> 
> Through Jesus Christ, who ever lives to make
> intercession for me. Amen.
