## Conclusion: Adapting These Templates

These templates are not meant to be rigid formulas but flexible frameworks to guide your prayer. The Puritans themselves adapted their approaches to different circumstances and needs. Feel free to modify these patterns to better suit your personality, circumstances, and spiritual journey. The goal is not to follow a particular method perfectly but to develop a rich, authentic prayer life that draws you closer to God.

Remember Richard Baxter's wise counsel: "Better be short and reverent, than long and neglectful." It's better to use a simpler prayer approach faithfully than to attempt a more complex one sporadically. Begin where you are, use what helps you most, and trust that God will guide your prayer journey.
