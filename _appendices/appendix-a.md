# Selected Puritan Prayers for Personal and Group Use

This appendix contains a collection of prayers from the Puritan tradition, carefully selected and gently updated for contemporary use. These prayers exemplify the depth, biblical richness, and spiritual insight that characterized Puritan approaches to prayer.

## How to Use These Prayers

These prayers can be used in several ways:

1. **Personal Devotion**: Read them slowly as part of your personal prayer time, allowing their biblical language and theological depth to shape your own prayers.

2. **Group Prayer**: Use them as opening or closing prayers in small groups or church gatherings.

3. **Meditation**: Select phrases or sections to meditate on throughout the day.

4. **Models for Your Own Prayers**: Study their structure and content as models for developing your own rich prayer life.

The language has been moderately updated for clarity while preserving the distinctive voice and theological richness of the original prayers.

> misused Your name,
> profaned Your worship,
> neglected Your Word,
> and resisted Your grace.
> 
> I have preferred trivial pleasures
> above eternal joy,
> and heaped sin upon sin,
> as if bent on my own destruction.
> 
> I have little loved what You command,
> and too much loved what You forbid.
> 
> But, Lord, I hate my sins,
> and beg Your mercy through Christ Jesus.
> Wash me in His blood,
> teach me by Your Spirit,
> and receive me as Your child,
> forgiven and restored.
> 
> For Christ's sake. Amen.
