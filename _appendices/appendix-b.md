# Annotated Bibliography: Resources for Further Study

This bibliography provides carefully selected resources for those who wish to deepen their understanding of Puritan prayer traditions and incorporate their insights into contemporary spiritual practice. The selections range from accessible introductions to more scholarly works, from primary Puritan texts to modern adaptations.

## Primary Puritan Sources

### *The Valley of Vision: A Collection of Puritan Prayers and Devotions*
*Edited by Arthur Bennett (Banner of Truth Trust, 2003)*

This beloved collection contains over 200 prayers drawn from various Puritan sources, sensitively modernized while preserving their theological richness. Organized thematically, it offers prayers for morning and evening, seasons of the Christian year, and various spiritual needs. Though not strictly a historical document (the editor adapted and compiled these prayers from various sources), it faithfully represents the spirit and substance of Puritan devotion. An ideal introduction to Puritan spirituality for contemporary readers.

### *The Works of Richard Baxter*
*Various editions*

Baxter's writings, particularly *The Reformed Pastor* and *A Christian Directory*, contain some of the most practical and comprehensive Puritan guidance on prayer. His *Method for a Settled Peace of Conscience* offers wisdom for those struggling with anxiety in prayer. Though his complete works run to many volumes, selected editions of these key texts are available from various publishers, including Soli Deo Gloria and Banner of Truth.

### *The Complete Works of John Owen*
*Various editions*

Owen's writings on prayer are scattered throughout his works, with particularly valuable insights in *Communion with God* and *The Grace and Duty of Being Spiritually Minded*. More challenging than Baxter, Owen rewards the patient reader with profound theological depth. Abridged and modernized versions of his key works are available for those who find his original prose difficult.

### *The Christian's Daily Walk*
*Henry Scudder (1627, various modern editions)*

This practical Puritan manual for daily devotion includes detailed guidance on prayer, Scripture meditation, and self-examination. More accessible than many Puritan writers, Scudder offers specific advice that remains remarkably relevant for establishing consistent spiritual disciplines.

### *A Method for Prayer*
*Matthew Henry (1710, various modern editions)*

Though Henry is best known for his Bible commentary, this lesser-known work provides a comprehensive guide to prayer based on Scripture. It includes patterns for prayer using biblical language, making it a practical resource for those wanting to incorporate Scripture into their prayers.

## Modern Studies of Puritan Prayer and Spirituality

### *Praying with the Puritans*
*Gary A. Parrett (P&R Publishing, 2022)*

This accessible introduction focuses specifically on Puritan approaches to prayer, with chapters on preparation, structure, fervency, and obstacles to prayer. Each chapter includes contemporary applications and exercises. Ideal for individual or group study.

### *Puritan Spiritual Practices in Everyday Life*
*Lee Gatiss (Christian Focus, 2021)*

This practical guide explores how Puritans integrated spiritual disciplines into daily routines. The chapters on prayer, self-examination, and Scripture meditation are particularly valuable for understanding the integrated nature of Puritan devotion.

### *A Habitual Sight of Him: The Christ-Centered Piety of Thomas Goodwin*
*Joel R. Beeke and Mark Jones (Reformation Heritage Books, 2021)*

This focused study examines how one prominent Puritan centered his prayer and devotional life on Christ. Though more scholarly than some resources, it offers rich insights into the Christocentric nature of Puritan spirituality.

### *Puritan: All of Life to the Glory of God*
*Stafford Carson and Joel Beeke (Reformation Heritage Books, 2019)*

This richly illustrated companion to the documentary series of the same name provides an accessible overview of Puritan life and thought, with several chapters on prayer and devotional practices. Includes helpful timelines, biographical sketches, and glossaries.

### *Hearing God's Word: Meditative Techniques from Richard Baxter and Matthew Henry*
*Jennifer McDonald (Baker Academic, 2023)*

This recent study examines how two influential Protestant figures taught believers to engage with Scripture devotionally. Their approaches to "praying the Scriptures" are presented in a way that contemporary Christians can readily apply.

## Contemporary Resources Influenced by Puritan Prayer Traditions

### *Praying the Bible*
*Donald S. Whitney (Crossway, 2015)*

Whitney adapts the Puritan practice of praying through Scripture for contemporary readers. His straightforward method, particularly focused on praying through the Psalms, builds directly on Puritan approaches while being accessible to modern readers.

### *A Call to Prayer*
*J.C. Ryle (Banner of Truth, 2022 edition)*

Though Ryle (1816-1900) came after the Puritan era, his work on prayer strongly reflects Puritan influences. This brief work offers direct, practical encouragement for developing a consistent prayer life. The contemporary edition includes helpful study questions.

### *The Valley of Vision Prayer Journal*
*Banner of Truth Trust (2023)*

This journal pairs selections from the classic Puritan prayer collection with space for personal reflection and prayer. The guided prompts help readers apply Puritan prayer insights to contemporary situations.

### *Take Words With You: Scripture Promises and Prayers*
*Tim Kerr (2013, 2021)*

This modern prayer manual organizes Scripture by topic for use in prayer, following the Puritan practice of praying God's words back to Him. Though not explicitly about Puritan prayer, it embodies their approach to Scripture-saturated prayer.

## Academic Studies

*Edited by Kelly M. Kapic and Randall C. Gleason (IVP Academic, 2004)*

This collection of scholarly essays introduces key Puritan texts, including several focused on prayer and devotion. Each chapter provides historical context, summary of the work's key ideas, and suggestions for contemporary application.

### *Puritan Reformed Spirituality*

This scholarly yet accessible work explores various aspects of Puritan spirituality, with significant attention to their prayer practices. Beeke offers both historical analysis and suggestions for contemporary application.
